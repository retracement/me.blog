<p>The second and final day of general sessions arrives and I manage to leave my room with a little more time to spare than yesterday. Again, I grab a bite to eat in the exhibitor room and then find myself a good seat for the keynote day 2. This time it was lead by Scott Johnson (COO of Docker) and focused again on Docker Enterprise Edition but with a strong focus on the MTA program and migrating legacy apps to Docker. The atmosphere was slightly more subdued today -probably because people were nursing hangovers from last nights party, but I was intrigued by a few things. For instance, when they talked about migrating a legacy .NET app and modernizing it to Docker, it wasn&rsquo;t really clear to me whether doing so was also irradicating dependencies on older .NET frameworks.</p>
<p>During the break between the keynote and first session, I decided to pick up where I left off with the Docker Labs and managed to go through the Docker on Linux 101 and Docker on Windows 101 excercises. Apart from a few minor typos in the demo code, these worked really well, although the Windows environment was noticeably slower than Linux which was a little frustrating. I decided to skip the first session so I could work my way through more lab material which took me up to lunchtime.</p>
<p>For my first session of the day I decided to attend <em>Docker EE Deep Dive</em> by Patrick Devine, which I found quite interesting but felt that it didn&rsquo;t quite go as <em>&ldquo;deep&rdquo;</em> as I&rsquo;d like to have seen.  That said, I am convinced that I need to spend more time familiarizing myself with Enterprise Edition if I am ever going to make a success of my <em>&ldquo;microservices journey&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017/eedeep.jpg" alt="docker history"></p>
<p>After lunch, I decided to speak with a few more storage solution vendors and deliberated whether to go to my second session of the day. None of the sessions that were on offer grabbed me enough, so I decided to extend my adventures with the lab environment and worked through a few more scenarios. So by the time my next session arrived, I was really looking forward to it and chose <em>Becoming the Docker Champion: Bringing Docker Back to Work</em> by Jim Armstrong. To be honest, I was more than a little disappointed that the content was not technical and focused more on the <em>&ldquo;politics&rdquo;</em> of the workplace and your company&rsquo;s staff motivations for adopting of Docker (or not). For me, this was largely a waste of my time even though Jim presented the session well, the session needed really to live in a management track (had one existed). During the next long break, I headed back to the Lab area and continued to work through the material. After the last session, I deliberated whether I should attend the last session of the day (of which a Serverless panel was quite appealing), and ultimately came to the conclusion that it was probably more worthwhile if I continued working my way through the labs.</p>
<p>That was really the end of (a slightly disappointing) day, but at least I got some good value from the Labs. In the evening I struggled to remote onto my machine back home so I could watch the Chelsea v Roma game and failed. Therefore I had to resort to finding a hooky stream which kept cutting out every 5-10 minutes. Even though Chelsea went 2-0 up quite early on, the match ended 3-3 to compound my disappointment!</p>
<p>Tomorrow is my last day in Denmark, in which I will be attending one the post-conference Summits.</p>
