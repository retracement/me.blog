      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/images/2019/azurecli.png&#34; alt=&#34;Azure CLI&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is now a variety of Microsoft provided command line tools available to connect to (and manage) Azure Resources and the situation is quite confusing to new-comers or those individuals who have not kept up to date with new developments. This post is designed to rectify this situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is probably also worth me mentioning that I am focusing on the usage and deployment of these tools with Linux in mind, however, the following explanation is also applicable to Windows and macOS environments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Installing Azure CLI on Linux Mint</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Azure CLI (or Azure Command Line Interface) allows provides an easy way to create and manage your Azure resources on macOS, Linux, and Windows. If you (like me) are using Linux and wish to use and control &lt;a href=&#34;https://portal.azure.com&#34;&gt;Microsoft Azure&lt;/a&gt; easily through the command line, then it is probably something you should have.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write a very quick post in order to explain the very simple steps you must follow to get the Azure CLI working for you if are using an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Ubuntu_derivatives&#34;&gt;Ubuntu derivative distribution&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://linuxmint.com/&#34;&gt;Linux Mint&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft’s basic installation guide &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-apt?view=azure-cli-latest&#34;&gt;Install Azure CLI with apt&lt;/a&gt; has one specific problem for those distros, so let’s take a look at the Ubuntu section of that guide:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setting up Samba on Linux Mint (the easy way)</title>

Samba is a file and print sharing suite of utilities in Linux which uses and provides integration with other machines using the SMB transport.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-this-quick-guide-covers&#34;&gt;What this quick guide covers&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you only want to provide basic folder sharing capabilities from your Linux distribution of choice, configuration and setup of Samba is (in my humble opinion) over complicated at best and a little bit messy at worst.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Configuring Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 for YUM without a Redhat Subscription</title>
      <link>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2016/10/11/rhelyum/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a very long time since I have installed a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/whats-new-red-hat-enterprise-linux-7&#34;&gt;Redhat Enterprise Linux&lt;/a&gt; distribution having tended to prefer Ubuntu based distributions (such as Linux Mint) or CentOS if I really wanted a Redhat derivative (although for Oracle Database installations on Linux, I would always tend to use Oracle Enterprise Linux for simplicity). With the development and impending arrival of SQL Server on Linux, I thought it was about time that I returned back to the playground with a vanilla copy of Redhat EL so that I could test it with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/cloud-platform/sql-server-on-linux&#34;&gt;SQL Server&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/&#34;&gt;Docker Linux Containers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://spark.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Spark&lt;/a&gt; and lots of other sexy things that have been avoiding my immediate attention for a little too long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fixing Flash in Chrome/ Chromium on Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/images/2015/parliament_not_working.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Flash not working&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Linux works it works well, and when it doesn’t it can be a real pain in the backside. Usually though, the failings are not necessarily the fault of the OS, but more the fault of the way in which packages, snap-ins, extensions and other third party code is deployed. Granted, it doesn’t really help that there are numerous methods and &lt;em&gt;Package Managers&lt;/em&gt; available to install applications, codecs and their ilk, but often the fault lies partially with the Third-party vendors for not making the process as easy and transparent as possible (especially for the less technical savvy amongst us).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; Although the following post is Linux related my dear SQL Server geek, you might just find what I am about to say useful in your pursuit of SQL Server greatness. If this possibility doesn&amp;rsquo;t interest you then I advise to stop reading right&amp;hellip; now!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t normally publish short blog posts and as a result, when I am really busy, it means nothing gets posted due to the large amount of time the bigger articles take. However from time to time I see something that I really want to shout about and this is one of those times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to run SQL Server on Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE 2011-04-10: PLEASE NOTE THIS WAS AN APRILS FOOL JOKE 🙂&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well I have finally cracked it, after years of trying (and a little help from the R2 release) to get SQL Server to install and run happily on the Linux Platform. I could hardly believe it when it all came together, but I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased that it has. What is even more exciting is that the performance of the SQL Engine is going through the roof.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Gnome to Flux</title>
      <link>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2011/01/25/from-gnome-to-flux/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2011 07:31:00 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In between the time I am looking into all things SQL and all things Microsoft I am usually tinkering in Linux, and this usually consists of tweaking my user desktop environment so that I may have a more productive and enjoyable experience – you might recall the post &lt;a href=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2010/08/03/my-big-fat-greek-desktop&#34;&gt;My Big Fat Greek Desktop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/images/2011/my_menu.png&#34; alt=&#34;Flux Menu&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I knew the time would come when I would finally move on from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnome.org/&#34;&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt; desktop on my trusty Linux boxes, and I had toyed with that idea several times without the jump. Over the last few weeks and months I have been trialling &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=1523&#34;&gt;Linux Mint Fluxbox&lt;/a&gt; edition and to be honest I really didn&amp;rsquo;t like it at first. One of the things that struck me was the simplicity of it, but then that was the whole point for the move. Simplicity equals speed and speed equals productivity as long as I could navigate my way around. One of the things that I first hated about this desktop that I now love, was the right-click behaviour on the taskbar. For instance if you right-click any running application on the taskbar, a close signal is sent to the application. At this stage you might be thinking that this would drive you mad and believe me for a small amount of time it did -until I started to realise actually how many times I right-click applications in Gnome or Windows and then do something with the context menu -which is usually always to close anyway. This action has now been reduced to a one-click operation, and I find that I am not constantly minimizing or maximizing windows all the time because I can close applications very quickly and tend to do just that. The other part of the equation (opening applications) can also be performed very quickly by moving the mouse to any part of the blank desktop, some of which can always be found at the bottom left and bottom right of the taskbar and right-clicking. This initially was a real pain until I discovered that the Fluxbox menus can be easily edited and customized to your requirements via a simple text edit of the menu files under the .fluxbox directory in your home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to create CD ISO image In Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may recall me mentioning the dd command from a previous post many moons ago in &lt;a href=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2009/11/09/cloning-and-expanding-virtualbox-disks-its-not-that-hard&#34;&gt;Cloning and Expanding VirtualBox Disks&lt;/a&gt; and saw for yourself how incredibly easy Linux and useful can be at times. Well lets put dd to a similar use -and a common necessity for all of us from time to time, especially in relation to building virtual machines quickly. I am of course talking about creating ISO cd/dvd images from physical media.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt;&#xA;Although this post may look at first to be about Linux and whilst many of you visiting this post will be either Windows or SQL centric you might think this is not for you. &lt;em&gt;Actually you are exactly the right people to be reading it because I want you to understand that you have options out there open to you&lt;/em&gt;. Your desktop can be a blank piece of paper and you can draw what you want. You are not constrained by software boundaries if you do not want to be. My desktop is all about flexibility, speed and usability. I can do anything I want whether it be Linux, Windows, SQL, Oracle whatever on my beloved desktop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Installing the Citrix client on Linux</title>
      <link>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2010/05/12/installing-citrix-client-on-linuxcertify-your-client/</link>

      <guid>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2010/05/12/installing-citrix-client-on-linuxcertify-your-client/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first step of installing Citrix client on your Linux machine is to first obtain the package. From Citrix&amp;rsquo;s website download the tarball of the Citrix Receiver.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/images/2010/citrix1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Citrix clients&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Extract the tarball&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/images/2010/citrix2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Extract&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and run the setupwfc executable. Select the first menu item to start the installer, and keep defaults. Once the installer has completed, exit the installer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/images/2010/citrix3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Run setup&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once complete you should try launching a published Citrix Application. At this stage you will probably encounter a client error message &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;You have not chosen to trust &amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo;, the issuer of the server&amp;rsquo;s security certificate (SSL error 61).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day, due to a long distance friendship, I really thought it was time to try and get Skype up and running on one of my Linux machines (currently running the Helena release of Mint).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Upon plugging in the USB cam (a nice little Logitech Quickcam Communicate STX), all initially looked promising with a little blue light briefly coming on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Downloading and installation of Skype occurred without incident, and I then proceeded to set-up my account. Unfortunately when I can to set-up my video device, even though Skype looked like it could see one, clicking the test button just had no effect and the screen was black.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a good tip from a fellow blogger which for all those people (like me) who have lots of tweeks and customisations here and there might just get fed up of constantly resizing their xterm settings. Works an absolute treat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codealpha.net/36/how-to-change-the-gnome-terminal-default-size-ubuntu/&#34;&gt;http://www.codealpha.net/36/how-to-change-the-gnome-terminal-default-size-ubuntu/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/images/2009/xtermdefaults.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;change xterm defaults&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Its just a shame that it is currently not possible to do this through the xterm profile settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you frequently download large files in many parts then you are probably not a stranger to HJSplit. This application can be used to connect these parts back together and is quite frankly completely unnecessary since your operating system likely already has a way! So how do you do it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lets say you have just downloaded the following files:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;big_file_part.iso.001&#xA;big_file_part.iso.002&#xA;big_file_part.iso.003&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To join these into one big file:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Windows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;rsquo;m just typing this from my new (extra) desktop setup at home installed to Linux Mint 8.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got to say that it just keeps getting better. Unlike my recent disappointment with the latest Windows offerings (excepting Windows 7 because it is too early for me to fairly judge), I have been very pleased with the latest Mint offering. Not only does it retain it&amp;rsquo;s familiar interface (which I have to say is why linux may imo one day trump Windows), but it appears crisper, more user friendly and accessible than ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You always know when someone is very knowledgeable about a subject by the way in which they answer a question. A simple question is always answered with a simple solution, and this is what happened to me recently when I wanted to expand or migrate a virtualbox virtual disk attached to a real physical disk partition so that I could double my capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem was that I had built a virtual machine with a 16GB disk and realised pretty quickly that it was not going to be enough, so I posed a question to the Linux gurus &amp;ldquo;how do I clone a disk in Linux?&amp;rdquo;. Sure enough the reply came &amp;ldquo;&lt;code&gt;dd if=source of=destination bb=512&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a very long time now (over 10 years) I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying very hard to &amp;ldquo;get into&amp;rdquo; Linux and there has always been a major obstacle hit along the way to make me put the OS back on the shelf for another day. Over this last year I have been seriously looking into a few distributions and I am very impressed. Whilst everything is not perfect, I have been very surprised how polished everything is begining to look and if I was Microsoft I would be really starting to look over my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
