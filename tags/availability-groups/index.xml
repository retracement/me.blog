      <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I keep hearing myself mentioning more and more in conversation (and most recently in a discussion group at &lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlbits.com/&#34;&gt;SQLBits&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago) is the ability to configure your Windows Cluster Quorum for situations where each cluster node may not be of equal importance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/en/us/default.aspx&#34;&gt;SQL Server 2012&lt;/a&gt; we have various high availability enhancements and improvements and most of these are branded under the term &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/en/us/solutions-technologies/mission-critical-operations/SQL-Server-2012-high-availability.aspx&#34;&gt;AlwaysOn&lt;/a&gt;. In particular we have enhancements to AlwaysOn SQL Failover Clustering and a new technology known as AlwaysOn Availability Groups. Whilst I won’t bore you with any specific details about what these are or how to use them -since that is no doubt something for another day, you may probably be already aware that for both, each require the existence of a Windows Cluster in order to use them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone once said to me that he thought I should work as a GUI tester since I always seemed to find problems in the UI -after I had highlighted a problem to him that I&amp;rsquo;d found in Linux Gnome which he had never seen before &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;after all his years working with the product&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. I guess there is an element of truth to that statement since I really do like clicking around and trying different things. However I suspect that my latest discovery won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily be one of those obscure problems that no-one else comes across since it is such an obvious problem and fairly easy to run into.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
