      <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone once said to me that he thought I should work as a GUI tester since I always seemed to find problems in the UI -after I had highlighted a problem to him that I’d found in Linux Gnome which he had never seen before &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;after all his years working with the product&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. I guess there is an element of truth to that statement since I really do like clicking around and trying different things. However I suspect that my latest discovery won’t necessarily be one of those obscure problems that no-one else comes across since it is such an obvious problem and fairly easy to run into.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s rather ironic that the answer to a question that came my way recently, had been sitting in my feed-reader for the last month. Apart from the length of time that the item/s had been sitting there, I had opened them on numerous occasions and re-marked as &lt;em&gt;unread&lt;/em&gt; because I believed they needed more than just a quick skim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I consider myself very experienced with SQL Clustering but one cannot know everything about everything. I&amp;rsquo;m endeavouring to fill any gaps in order to be not just very good, but hopefully at some point a leading (or how about &lt;em&gt;the leading&lt;/em&gt; expert in this field. Right now there are only a few people that I am aware of that I consider to be authorities in SQL Clustering -at least people I can learn from, I&amp;rsquo;ve even been using it as long as some of them. There will of course be more experts who I am unaware of but the ones I follow are Geoff Hiten, Allan Hirt and Symon Perriman of course! Whether I achieve my own personal aims will depend upon how many other areas of specialism I lend my eye to, but one can only try and right now I think I&amp;rsquo;ve been heading in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
