      <description>&lt;p&gt;Introduced with SQL Server 2014, In-Memory OLTP (IMOLTP) provided a new optimistic concurrency model which implemented a lockless and latchless mechanism resulting in far better throughput for short concurrent OLTP workloads. Unlike the traditional on-disk concurrency model, IMOLTP stores table data as data rows in-memory (rather than in-buffer page structures) and this data (or changes to it) will eventually be asynchronously written into checkpoint file pair structures on-disk. Given that the speed of physical disk is no longer a major consideration for the speed of data changes when compared against the traditional on-disk concurrency model, you would presume that we no longer need to worry too much about their performance. Unfortunately, we have something else to consider – the transaction log.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
