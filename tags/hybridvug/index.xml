      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is with a tinge of sadness that we announce the Oracle Virtual Chapter is no more, but do not despair, all is not lost!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Around 14 months ago the leadership of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://oracle.sqlpass.org/Home.aspx&#34;&gt;Oracle Virtual Chapter&lt;/a&gt; changed hands after it had laid dormant for approximately the same length of time as from then to now. Back then &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlpass.org/&#34;&gt;PASS&lt;/a&gt; were not entirely convinced that there was an audience or market for this Chapter, but we discussed our vision for it’s future and for a time the VC had a stay of execution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
