      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE 2011-04-10: PLEASE NOTE THIS WAS AN APRILS FOOL JOKE 🙂&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well I have finally cracked it, after years of trying (and a little help from the R2 release) to get SQL Server to install and run happily on the Linux Platform. I could hardly believe it when it all came together, but I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased that it has. What is even more exciting is that the performance of the SQL Engine is going through the roof.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you are one of those people who&amp;rsquo;s house is immaculate? The lid is firmly placed back on the toothpaste, shoes left in a neat pile, coat in the cupboard. You know the sort of thing? Well I&amp;rsquo;m not quite like that but I try to be. Organized effort is a good thing and although it might not be obvious at the time can make life so much more easier further down the line.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Automating your SQL snapshots</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A little while ago I was talking to someone about possibilities of reporting from SQL Server to avoid impacting the production server and the very first thing that sprang to mind was for them to use snapshotting from a mirror. They had already considered this option but it was not really viable because an almost real-time reporting solution was required. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until later that I wondered whether I had not really been precise enough in my explanation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Where to go for WAIT stat information</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fairly recently I was talking with a rather talented SQL Specialist internally at Microsoft and was asked the question by him as to where I get my Wait Stat information from. Query tuning isn&amp;rsquo;t really something I currently am required to do on a regular basis so I tend to get my information as and when I need it (even though I have a couple of articles and urls bookmarked I couldn&amp;rsquo;t particularly reference them in a conversation so perhaps I could go one better and officially post them). My answer then was that I Bing for my Wait Stat references (actually replace that with another search engine – but I was on the MS site!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
