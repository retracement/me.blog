      <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone once said to me that he thought I should work as a GUI tester since I always seemed to find problems in the UI -after I had highlighted a problem to him that I’d found in Linux Gnome which he had never seen before &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;after all his years working with the product&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. I guess there is an element of truth to that statement since I really do like clicking around and trying different things. However I suspect that my latest discovery won’t necessarily be one of those obscure problems that no-one else comes across since it is such an obvious problem and fairly easy to run into.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lock Compatibility Matrix 1.2</title>
      <link>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2011/11/17/compatibility-matrix-1-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of months back I published my version of SQL Server’s Lock Compatibility Matrix under the post &lt;a href=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2011/09/27/fancy-a-decent-compatibility-matrix&#34;&gt;Fancy a decent Compatibility Matrix?&lt;/a&gt; since the one provided by MSDN is really very poorly designed and difficult for the average Joe to understand.This is one reason I believe that lock compatibility is a very misunderstood subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing that has bothered me about my version from the very beginning was the use of green and red to respectively indicate compatible or incompatible locks. The reason this has bothered me from the offset is because I was aware that those two colours could be a very big problem for colour blind DBAs. However, for me they really DID look great together and &lt;em&gt;told the story&lt;/em&gt; of the compatibility between the locks without even needing words -every (non colour blind) person understands the concept of GREEN -&amp;gt; GO (i.e. lock grant), RED -&amp;gt; STOP (i.e. lock wait). BUT that doesn&amp;rsquo;t help colour blind people very much does it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fancy a decent Compatibility Matrix?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever taken a look at Microsoft’s published &lt;a href=&#34;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186396.aspx&#34;&gt;compatibility matrix&lt;/a&gt; for SQL Server lock compatibility? If you have, then I don’t need to tell you that it sucks in a very big way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have no fear, I have painstakingly redrawn at better one (via PowerPoint no less!) and am making available to you totally free of charge as a lovely PDF slide found via &lt;a href=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/documents/readpastfuriouslockcompatibilitymatrix.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip; Why you ask? Because I love you all!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When should you use NOLOCK?</title>
      <link>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2011/09/14/when-should-you-use-nolock/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well the quick answer to that question is never. And there you have it, the quickest blog post in history (perhaps!).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;…Except that I should really have said &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;When should you use &lt;code&gt;READUNCOMMITTED&lt;/code&gt; isolation or hint?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; and then the question takes a little more of a surprising turn. Let me first start and explain why I have categorically ruled against the use of &lt;code&gt;NOLOCK&lt;/code&gt;. The reason, is that at some point in the dim and distant future Microsoft may decide to remove this hint from the product. If they could do it today, they probably would; the only thing that is really stopping them is the numerous lines of external T-SQL code that dirtys the floors of many Development teams around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Review of Inside the SQL Server Query Optimizer</title>

As someone I’ve been following technically for several years, when I saw that his book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Inside-SQL-Server-Query-Optimizer/dp/1906434603&#34;&gt;Inside the SQL Server Query Optimizer&lt;/a&gt; had been released to the Kindle format, I immediately clicked the purchase button and I haven’t been disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I’ve not been able to participate in T-SQL Tuesday for a while so it is good to catch this one which is made easier by keeping a close eye on what Rob Farley (&lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlblog.com/blogs/rob_farley/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rob_farley&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;) is up to because he is always on time every time! Here’s my entry…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using SQL Server Scalable Shared Database</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/images/2011/orders.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Presentation slide&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Several weeks ago now I had the honour of presenting at the very first ever SQLRally event in Orlando Florida and I gave a presentation around the very large (no pun intended) subject of scaling out your SQL Server data. At the end of one of my demos it unfortunately crashed and burned and the annoying thing was, that up to then it had worked flawlessly!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem that I hit in the demo was (I believe) related to a virtual machine crash that had happened the previous evening and I don’t think I allowed the database to run through recovery the following day. I am presuming that my iSCSI targets were not connected to my SQL Server on startup which meant that the database in question which was located on my shared drive still needed to run through recovery and couldn’t because I had (as part of the demo) changed the attribute of the drive to read-only in order to prepare it for the next stage. The error was suggesting that there was a version compatibility problem between the two instances and I had several members of the audience suggesting that this was the problem when I knew the versions were identical. Disappointingly, we were so short of time that I needed to move on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to run SQL Server on Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATE 2011-04-10: PLEASE NOTE THIS WAS AN APRILS FOOL JOKE 🙂&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well I have finally cracked it, after years of trying (and a little help from the R2 release) to get SQL Server to install and run happily on the Linux Platform. I could hardly believe it when it all came together, but I&amp;rsquo;m very pleased that it has. What is even more exciting is that the performance of the SQL Engine is going through the roof.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you are one of those people who&amp;rsquo;s house is immaculate? The lid is firmly placed back on the toothpaste, shoes left in a neat pile, coat in the cupboard. You know the sort of thing? Well I&amp;rsquo;m not quite like that but I try to be. Organized effort is a good thing and although it might not be obvious at the time can make life so much more easier further down the line.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Automating your SQL snapshots</title>
      <link>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2011/02/15/automating-your-snapshots/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2011 16:49:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2011/02/15/automating-your-snapshots/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A little while ago I was talking to someone about possibilities of reporting from SQL Server to avoid impacting the production server and the very first thing that sprang to mind was for them to use snapshotting from a mirror. They had already considered this option but it was not really viable because an almost real-time reporting solution was required. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until later that I wondered whether I had not really been precise enough in my explanation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Where to go for WAIT stat information</title>
      <link>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2011/02/08/where-to-go-for-your-wait-stat-information/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2011 21:07:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2011/02/08/where-to-go-for-your-wait-stat-information/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fairly recently I was talking with a rather talented SQL Specialist internally at Microsoft and was asked the question by him as to where I get my Wait Stat information from. Query tuning isn&amp;rsquo;t really something I currently am required to do on a regular basis so I tend to get my information as and when I need it (even though I have a couple of articles and urls bookmarked I couldn&amp;rsquo;t particularly reference them in a conversation so perhaps I could go one better and officially post them). My answer then was that I Bing for my Wait Stat references (actually replace that with another search engine – but I was on the MS site!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
