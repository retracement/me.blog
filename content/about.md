Hi there and thank you for dropping by my pages!
My name is Mark Broadbent and I am a Microsoft Certified Master in SQL Server (there are approximately 28 of us in the UK and 220 worldwide, although this certification has now been grandfathered) and a former 7 time Microsoft Data Platform MVP focusing on Microsoft Azure, Azure DevOps, SQL Server, Administration, Development, Business Intelligence, Docker, Data Factory, and Cosmos DB. I also have strong expertise in concurrency, performance, high availability, disaster recovery, virtualization, Windows and Linux, C# and dotNET.

I am the technical editor to [SQL Server on Linux (published 2018, McGraw-Hill)](https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-SQL-Server-2017-Linux-ebook/dp/B07DCH314W/), and the technical reviewer to [High Performance SQL Server: Consistent Response for Mission-Critical Applications 2nd Edition (published 2021, Apress)](https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-SQL-Server-Mission-Critical-ebook/dp/B08TQR3NMF), [SQL Server Query Tuning and Optimization: Optimize Microsoft SQL Server 2022 queries and applications (published 2022, Apress)](https://www.amazon.com/SQL-Server-Query-Tuning-Optimization/dp/1803242620), and [Expert SQL Server Transactions and Locking Concurrency Internals for SQL Server Practitioners (published 2018, Apress)](https://www.amazon.com/Expert-Server-Transactions-Locking-Practitioners-ebook/dp/B07FXCW836).

I am a strong believer in community and have previously founded and lead SQLSaturday Cambridge, SharePoint Saturday Cambridge, East Anglia SQL Server User Group, SQL Nexus (as co-founder), and [Hybrid Virtual Group](https://www.meetup.com/hybrid-virtual-group/) (of which is still running). I have been a recipient of the PASS Outstanding Volunteer award and Microsoft Community Contributor awards.

I am an experienced international conference speaker, having delivered sessions to hundreds of on-premises and online events including Microsoft Future Decoded, PASS Summit, SQLRally, SQLSaturday, SQL Nexus, SQLBits, 24 Hours of PASS, and SQLRelay.
