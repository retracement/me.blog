We are very pleased to announce that the final figures of the SQLSaturday Cambridge fundraising has been counted.

Some of you will know that we were collecting for Children's Cancer Charity [CLIC Sargent](https://www.younglivesvscancer.org.uk/) and the reasons why we were doing this can be understood by reading my previous post [Change (your event) and make a difference!](/posts/2013/09/25/change-your-event-and-make-a-difference).

The amount collected at the event through various different means amounts to **£490.03**!!!

SQLSaturday Cambridge are therefore honoring our commitment to match this figure, which means that <mark>we are therfore donating a grand total of £980.06 to charity</mark>. I'm hoping to write a bit more about this further in due course.

Thank you so much to Sponsors, Speakers, Volunteers and Attendees who have all played their part in making this happen, you should be proud of yourselves. I cannot wait to hand over this cheque to CLIC Sargent and hope in due course to get some nice photos to show you!
