*A pre-conference good enough for Super heros*

In exactly 2 days time the United Kingdom's 3rd SQLSaturday will be in full swing, showcasing a group of SQL Server MVPs, MCMs and Community experts. This will be the very first time that SQLSaturday has happened in Scotland and it is going to be fantastic to bolster the PASS membership and exposure in that area which can only good news for all concerned.

If you have never been to Edinburgh before then you are in for a treat. It is a beautiful and historic City with lots to do for the family (should you bring them) or lots of shopping available for the wife on Princes Street -or if you have a house husband, then there are lots of pubs and coffee shops in large quantity.

Should you not already be registered, then shame on you! ...Call yourself a SQL Server Professional? Don't worry it is not too late, you can register for the free Saturday community day [here](https://www.sqlsaturday.com/202/register.aspx) and I believe if you are quick you might be able to still grab a place on the pre-conference day on Friday which will be hosted by the fabulous Joe Sack and masterful Jonathan Kehayias. For more details and booking for the pre-conference go to [here](https://sqlsaturdayedinburgh.com/training-day/).

p.s. Don't forget to come and say hello to me if you are there. I'll be presenting the last session of the day on [SQL Server AlwaysOn for Dummies](https://www.sqlsaturday.com/viewsession.aspx?sat=202&sessionid=12735), so if you are a dummy or higher, make sure you attend!
