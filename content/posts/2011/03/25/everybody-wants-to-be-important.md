I'm a very big fan of *self-development* materials whether they be books, audio, presentations or simply just ramblings on the Internet and last year during the *Meet an MVP lunch time at the SQL PASS 2010 Summit this was the hotly debated subject on our table.

I know these materials generally get a bad press and I always remember a line from one of our comedians here in the UK who was criticising self-improvement training and said *"the clue is in the name….self! ...so why are you listening to someone else!"*. For myself I believe that the "self" in the name self-improvement actually means that we always need to examine ourselves (and our behaviour) in order to grow into something better. One thing that I know for sure is that I have a lot of work ahead of me to become the person that I want to be and I know it is within my power to do so.

So now I have set the scene, I can move onto a classic line that I remember from the excellent (and one of my favourite self-improvement) books, the well known *How to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie*. Basically the line goes something like *"Remember that a person's name is to that person, the sweetest and most important sound in any language"*.

`Not everyone wants to be Lady Gaga…`

If you ever watch a debate on television (perhaps by politicians 🙂), just remember this idea and listen to the amount of times they use their opponents name in the conversation and watch their opponents reaction whenever this happens. Usually, in a really passionate discussion, the opponent will be slightly more pacified and less aggressive in their retort. Another quote which I always find really useful (especially when analysing my own reaction to situations) is that *everybody wants to be important*. I guess this fact is really obvious but not something we would normally think about, and obviously not everyone wants to be Lady Gaga, but everyone wants to have a voice and be respected for what they say. Knowing this in debates can help you sometimes take a back seat to allow other voices to be heard. If you talk too much and stop others getting their points across, then sooner or later, they will stop listening to you. Everybody loses.

So moving on (and desperately trying to wrap up) this blog post, I was recently quite pleased with myself when I saw a blog post by Ted Kruger ([blog](https://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/ITProfessionals/ProfessionalDevelopment/twitter-and-the-sql-help)|[twitter](https://twitter.com/onpnt)) celebrating the adoption of the #sqlhelp hashtag by the SQL community. I have really tried my best to make the time to help out with it myself and was pleased that my activity had been high enough to place me on the usage chart. It will not be every day that I beat Brent Ozar ([blog](https://www.brentozar.com/)|[twitter](https://twitter.com/brento)) at something but oh …yes my piece of pie is bigger than yours!!! 🙂

Obviously the purpose of #sqlhelp is not about back slapping or even personal gain but it is always nice to have your efforts recognized (especially by your peers) and my target (as always) is to continue and improve at helping the SQL Community through this and the other forums.

A belated Happy Birthday (whenever that was!) #sqlhelp
