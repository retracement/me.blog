Well the good news is my alarm clock worked!

So the time is around 7:30 am and I managed to get out of bed for my second official appointment of the PASS Summit 2011 and things are getting warmed up. I'm sat here on the front row of the Blogger table whilst to my left I have Brent Ozar, Aaron Bertrand and to my right Wes Brown and the Midnight DBA's. If that wasn't enough in front of me I have Stacia Misner and behind me I have Wendy Dance and Glen Berry! I don't know how I managed this gig but it feels really good and it is an absolute pleasure to be part of it all.

Well that's my first post for the day, onto writing the next one!
