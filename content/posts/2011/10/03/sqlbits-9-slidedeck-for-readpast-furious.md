I am very pleased to publish the slide-deck for my Friday presentation [READPAST & Furious: Transactions, Locking and Isolation](https://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event9/READPAST__Furious_Transactions_Locking_and_Isolation). Just click [here](/documents/readpastfurious.pdf) to obtain the slide-deck in PDF format.

I had an absolutely fantastic time giving the presentation and really enjoyed the audience participation (though it took some of you guys a bit of time to warm up 🙂). No seriously, the thing that makes all those weeks/ months of preparation and collation of material worthwhile is the possibility that I have managed to communicate something of value to you all -and *hopefully* I managed to do that. I learnt a massive amount of stuff myself in the process of preparing for this session and I cannot wait for the next time (whenever this may be).

Thank you very much to all those people who attended *and especially* those who have been to my presentations before. I can't tell you how much I appreciate you being there!
