Over the coming weeks and months leading up to SQLRally, I will be adding information, news and more detail about my presentation. For now though the root area is live which is effectively the "press release" provided to the selected speakers.

Don't forget, if you do see me wandering around in Orlando, to say hello. It's always great to meet new people and I am always humbled by the high level of skill in the SQL community. Also (and most importantly) expanding our IT Professional Support Network will ensure that we always will have an ear to bend when we have technical problems.
