Have you ever taken a look at Microsoft's published [compatibility matrix](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms186396.aspx) for SQL Server lock compatibility? If you have, then I don't need to tell you that it sucks in a very big way.

Have no fear, I have painstakingly redrawn at better one (via PowerPoint no less!) and am making available to you totally free of charge as a lovely PDF slide found via [here](/documents/readpastfuriouslockcompatibilitymatrix.pdf)... Why you ask? Because I love you all!

*Not too bad for version 1 eh!*

If you have any comments for improvements OR find any errors then please don't hesitate to contact me (you know how!).
