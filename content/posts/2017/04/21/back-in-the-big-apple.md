I am delighted to announce that I’ll once again be speaking at [SQLSaturday New York](https://http://www.sqlsaturday.com/588/eventhome.aspx) on the 20th May and this is my Third time speaking at this event and my FOURTH time speaking at the Microsoft offices in New York, after last year speaking at [SharePoint Saturday New York](https://href.li/?http://www.spsevents.org/city/NYC/nyc2016) (since the SQLSaturday didn’t run that year).

I’m a huge fan of the event and obviously, it is a mammoth task for the organizers to put on given the location and size of the audience, but I have always had great fun and (unexpectedly) refreshingly good feedback speaking there.

Last year I took the Wife to New York, which was a really strange change, being my first time traveling with her (without kids) for over 12 years! And the year before was pure insanity (but great fun) spent in the company of the [Hornernator](https://twitter.com/jasonhorner), [SQLWareWolf](https://twitter.com/sqlwarewolf), my long time pal [David Dye](https://twitter.com/derekman1) and a few other crazies! What happens in New York... stays in New York!

This year I will be talking about [In-Memory OLTP](https://www.sqlsaturday.com/588/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=63620), and judging by the agenda, you will be spoilt for choice on this subject matter, but I hope to provide you with some useful materials (for attendees only!) and offer something different, so I hope you can join me there.

I will, of course, be soaking in the sights of the Big Apple once more, and hopefully visiting the [Amazin’ Mets](https://www.mlb.com/mets) like I did last year! So if you are around New York City on the 20th of May, make sure you register for this brilliant event and come and say hello.
