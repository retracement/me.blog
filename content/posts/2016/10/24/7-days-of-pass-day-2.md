After arriving the day before, the threat of jetlag was always going to be there, but I thankfully managed to sleep until 4am and snoozed for a further hour. I started the day looking forward to the return of [Mourinho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho) to [Stamford Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)), but this time he was leading a different team ([Manchester United](https://www.manutd.com/)). I was of course hoping for a [Chelsea](https://https://www.chelseafc.com/) win, but my biggest challenge was trying to find somewhere to watch the match. My problem was that the game would kick off at 9am (Seattle time), so a sports bar wasn’t possible, so in the end, I found a dodgy streaming site which kind-of did the job. Four-Nil to Chelsea and I was a happy man!

Shortly after the game had finished, I met up with Craig Ottley-Thistlethwaite ([b](https://craigot.blogspot.com/)|[t](https://twitter.com/craig_ottley)) and Richard Douglas ([b](https://sql.richarddouglas.co.uk/)|[t](https://twitter.com/sqlrich)) again and we headed down to the [CenturyLink Field](https://www.centurylinkfield.com/) stadium in order to see the [Seattle Sounders](https://www.soundersfc.com/) game. In a strange piece of coincidence, this was against the exact same opponents as last year ([Real Salt Lake](https://www.rsl.com/)), so I was expecting a similar result. Before we hit the game, we checked into the [Elysian Fields bar](https://www.elysianbrewing.com/elysian-bar/) for a swift half and then promptly headed to our seats. While there was not enough *playing the ball* by both teams and too much lumping it in the air, I still enjoyed another Sounders win -this time 2-1 to the hosts.

During our walk home from the match, we stopped off at [Doc Maynard’s Public House](https://www.undergroundtour.com/about/dining.html) (the location of the [Seattle Underground tour](https://http://www.undergroundtour.com/)) to wash down the match beers with some Seattle Dry Cider. After Craig demonstrated his drinking credentials, we then headed back into Pike for our obligatory visit to the [Tap House](https://taphousegrill.com/) to grab some food and drink before I headed back to my room. Within minutes I promptly collapsed in an exhausted heap on my bed as the effects of a pseudo Snake-Bite took hold of my body.

Just another day in Seattle!
