If you have not already heard, SQL Nexus (a next generation SQL Server focused event) will be held on May 2nd – 4th 2016 in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The “idea” for SQL Nexus ([w](https://www.sqlnexus.com/)|[t](https://twitter.com/sqlnexus)) was first conceived in 2012 more as a future pipe dream than anything else and it was something that I had in mind when we delivered the second [SQLSaturday Cambridge in 2012](https://sqlsaturday.com/228/eventhome.aspx) in which we included a dedicated SharePoint track.

At that time, the idea was for a SQL Server centric conference that embraced the whole of the MS Data Platform but SQLSaturday did not feel like the ideal platform for something of the scale required. This vision was discussed with Régis in early 2013 and lay dormant while we were both very busy with alternative commitments. But every great idea needs great people, the right time and the right place and it is through the efforts of Régis Baccaro ([b](https://funkylab.com/)|[t](https://twitter.com/DoktorKermit)) and Kenneth M. Nielsen ([b](https://funkylab.com/)|[t](https://twitter.com/DoktorKermit)) over the last few months that has helped drive this idea forward into reality to what will be a sensational event.

Thanks also must go to the following companies who have been pivotal in making this event possible:

- [ASAP design](https://asapdesign.dk)
- [Funky.biz](https://funky.biz/)
- [Microsoft](https://Microsoft.dk)
- [bloodyuseful](https://bloodyuseful.dk)

The conference will be held on **May 2nd to 4th** at **Cinemaxx in Copenhagen** with one day of [pre-conference](https://www.sqlnexus.com/pre--and-main-conference.html) sessions and 2 full days of breakout sessions. The program for the pre-conference is ready and will feature leading Data Platform professionals including:

- Allan Hirt ([b](https://sqlha.com/blog/)|[t](https://twitter.com/SQLHA))
- Itzik Ben-Gan ([b](https://tsql.solidq.com/)|[t](https://twitter.com/itzikbengan))
- Tim Chapman ([t](https://twitter.com/chapmandew))

...and many others!
