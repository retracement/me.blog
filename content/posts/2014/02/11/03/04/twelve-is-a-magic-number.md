A massive congratulations to the [SQLBits](https://www.sqlbits.com/) team for announcing what will become the 12th iteration of the UKs finest and largest SQL Server conference. Putting on events at this scale by such a small core team demands huge respect and I sincerely thank them for doing so. I have personally learnt a ton of information and grown as a person and as a SQL Professional because of their efforts and I know many others in the industry feel the same way too.

The location this year is [Telford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telford), and I must confess to not knowing a great deal about this Town in the West Midlands. After a close inspection of Wikipedia, it tells me that Telford is a new town formed in the 1960s and ’70s from a collection of neighbouring smaller towns and close by is the famous landmark known as [Ironbridge Gorge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironbridge_Gorge) which was the first Iron Bridge of its kind in the World! I was already familiar with this due to my Mother raving to me many years ago about a Sweet shop that can be found there where you could buy lots of Olde World favourites such as Poor Bens, Coltsfoot Rock and Lemon Sherberts 🙂

As always, I look forward to see what the organisers have planned for us all, and encourage you to check out the event as the details start trickling through and perhaps consider submitting a session? I know you won’t regret it and hope to see you there!
