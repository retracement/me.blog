*I liked the event so much, I bought the community*

If you ever asked an experienced speaker what is the best formula to follow when starting out on your road to presenting, they would most likely tell you to start *small* and work your way up to bigger events. First present to your work colleagues, next move onto User-Groups, then onto bigger events such as SQLSaturdays and then finally (when you are ready) talk at the biggest events in the World such as the PASS Summit (in the U.S.A) or SQLBits (in the U.K).

Never one to follow conventional wisdom it seems, my first ever SQLSaturday came on the 17th March 2012 in Lisbon, Portugal after having already presented four sessions at three different SQLBits Conferences, one session at the first ever SQLRally in Orlando and one session at the PASS Summit in Seattle. So far I had also not even come close to presenting at a SQL user group<sub>*1</sub>!

Many valuable lessons were learnt from that very first SQLSaturday experience, and many great friendships were formed, so I am perhaps even more delighted that this year that I have been selected again for my fifth SQLSaturday held in Portugal -a current record 🙂. Since that first time speaking at SQLSaturday Lisbon I have become a huge fan of that conference, community and country so decided that this year I would show my support in a slightly different way and through my company SQLCloud have become a Gold Sponsor.

The sessions I will be delivering are a 90 minute workshop titled [Triple Trouble – Running a SQL Failover Cluster on a Cluster from a Cluster](https://www.sqlsaturday.com/viewsession.aspx?sat=369&sessionid=26213) and a standard session titled [From Francesinha to Bacalhau: Real-World Database Optimization](https://www.sqlsaturday.com/viewsession.aspx?sat=369&sessionid=29552) and I very much hope you can join me for either (or both) of them!

If you can’t make these, then I may still see you during the pre-conference. I have registered to attend Dejan’s session ([Data Mining Algorithms in SQL Server, Excel, R and Azure ML](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bilhetes-data-mining-algorithms-in-sql-server-excel-r-and-azure-ml-by-dejan-sarka-14652811955)) in an attempt to improve my knowledge on Data Mining Algorithms and I am really looking forward to it. If this doesn’t sound like your cup of tea, then you also have the brilliant Paul White who will be delivering [Mastering Execution Plan Analysis](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bilhetes-mastering-execution-plan-analysis-by-paul-white-14652386683).

Ver você lá!

*<sub>*1</sub> Not entirely true. Whilst I had set up the Cambridgeshire SQL Server User Group during that year and hosted it’s first meeting, I hadn’t actually presented to any other user-groups at this stage.*
