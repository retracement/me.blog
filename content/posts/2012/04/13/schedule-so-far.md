Recently I have been starting to get a little stressed about whether or not I have a speaking engagement coming up.

Whilst I use [Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar) and most recently have set up a premium [Remember the Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/) account to organise my life a little better, I thought it was probably a good idea to see where I am with my past and forth coming presentations for the first half of this year.

I was quite surprised that I've already equalled the number of my presentations for the whole of last year...

If you are visiting any of these events please make sure to say hello, probably one of the biggest benefits of speaking at them is getting to know, meet and become friends with new people. I would just love to add you to my list!
