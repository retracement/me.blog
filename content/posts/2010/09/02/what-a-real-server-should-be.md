So I stumbled on this the other day and I really like this idea.

Anyone who remembers the days of Novell NetWare being King of the LANs would likely agree that you don't need a fancy GUI to have a server. Something which is still relevant to UX's today and thankfully Microsoft are starting to take notice. One thing I really like about Microsoft is that they do listen and are not too arrogant to think that only their opinion is the only one that matters.

I shan't go into why I believe a GUI is not something for a server right now, but all I can say is that I shall be looking into the restrictions and possibilities of the Server Core Installation in due course. I am confident that this could be the beginning of the end for GUI based servers for Windows, but then it couldn't really be called Windows any more could it? How about ... "Microsoft Server – Solid, fast and dependable!".
