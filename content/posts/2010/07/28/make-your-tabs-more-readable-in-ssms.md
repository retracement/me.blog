Just the other day I came across a post by Simon Sabin that highlighted some useful status bar and tab settings that have been introduced in SQL Server 2008.

For me this is fantastic, since it removes one of my few pet hates introduced by SSMS.

From SSMS, select *Tools/ Options* and under the *Text Editor* node remove all the connection settings you don't want in the tab.

Once the change is made, close down the existing tabs and any new ones that are opened will be formatted just as you have changed. I prefer to have just the filenames for the tabs, because all the connection settings can be viewed in the status bar.
