You may recall me mentioning the dd command from a previous post many moons ago in [Cloning and Expanding VirtualBox Disks](/posts/2009/11/09/cloning-and-expanding-virtualbox-disks-its-not-that-hard) and saw for yourself how incredibly easy Linux and useful can be at times. Well lets put dd to a similar use -and a common necessity for all of us from time to time, especially in relation to building virtual machines quickly. I am of course talking about creating ISO cd/dvd images from physical media.

Rather than regurgitate someone else's writings I shall point you to this excellent [blog post](https://www.walkernews.net/2007/09/22/how-to-create-cd-iso-image-in-linux/) (now several years old) on the steps required to create an image from physical media.

And as per normal, just in case over the duration of time the post disappears see a screen capture of the full article below.
