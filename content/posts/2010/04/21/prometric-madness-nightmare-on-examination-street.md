Today I spent a very entertaining 4 hours or so, finally taking (after 4 years of getting around to it) the SQL 2005 upgrade exam and had a bit of a 'mare. My first problem with this exam was that it started off with 7 or 8 mini-exams and these were essentially very large case studies that each had 5-8 questions attached. Now my first problem was that I must have spent the first 8 minutes of my allocated 15 for this one case study trying to figure out where the first question was! The number was displaying 1/8, however clicking the *"Question"* button simply didn’t change anything and I was left with the explanation of how to do these mini exams. Finally after coming across some text somewhere I realised that question 1 was in fact not a question but an introduction!!!! Was it beyond the wit of man to not start the question numbering post introduction?

Anyway, so now I’m motoring through and we are all good again, until I nearly get to the end of one of the latter questions and clicking *"Next"* no longer moves me to the next question any more. Worse than that, *"Previous"* doesn’t work either. All the other buttons work, but not the one I want. No one at the test centre had a clue either and eventually the time ran out on the mini-test and I missed the chance to answer that question.

I spent the remainder of the exam trying to stay focused and calm but it was flipping difficult I can tell you!

Thankfully I still passed this upgrade exam with flying colours, so now I will look to take my upgrade to the SQL 2008 certification as soon as possible.

I prey this one is less eventful...
