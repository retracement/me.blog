      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s rather ironic that the answer to a question that came my way recently, had been sitting in my feed-reader for the last month. Apart from the length of time that the item/s had been sitting there, I had opened them on numerous occasions and re-marked as &lt;em&gt;unread&lt;/em&gt; because I believed they needed more than just a quick skim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I consider myself very experienced with SQL Clustering but one cannot know everything about everything. I&amp;rsquo;m endeavouring to fill any gaps in order to be not just very good, but hopefully at some point a leading (or how about &lt;em&gt;the leading&lt;/em&gt; expert in this field. Right now there are only a few people that I am aware of that I consider to be authorities in SQL Clustering -at least people I can learn from, I&amp;rsquo;ve even been using it as long as some of them. There will of course be more experts who I am unaware of but the ones I follow are Geoff Hiten, Allan Hirt and Symon Perriman of course! Whether I achieve my own personal aims will depend upon how many other areas of specialism I lend my eye to, but one can only try and right now I think I&amp;rsquo;ve been heading in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is Disaster Recovery?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently asked &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;What is DR?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; when talking about SQL Clustering, Mirroring and the like to someone. The question was asked not because they didn&amp;rsquo;t know but because they were interested in what I thought. The answer is quite simple right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a moments pause I answered, &lt;em&gt;Disaster Recovery is the ability to restore a companies IT infrastructure to a minimum level required in order for that company to continue operating&lt;/em&gt;. OK so that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a really great response and of course DR means different things to different people, so it is probably important that we can be as explicit as possible. When the business asks &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Have you got a DR strategy in place&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, I personally believe that we should already have established with the Business what they would class as &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Recovery&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
