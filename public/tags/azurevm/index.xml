      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes some of the simplest tips are the best, and recently I was trying to figure out just how to upload SQL Server 2012 Enterprise/ Developer Edition installation files to my Windows Azure Virtual Machine since my pre-provisioned copy of SQL Server (Evaluation Edition) had expired.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As it turned out I realized pretty quickly that I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to bother since the VM also comes with a copy of SQL Server 2012 Evaluation Edition media pre-loaded at the root of the &lt;em&gt;C:\&lt;/em&gt; drive. All I had to do therefore was to grab an existing Developer Edition license key and run the Evaluation Edition media setup and step through the Edition Upgrade to &lt;em&gt;convert&lt;/em&gt; my existing instance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
