      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Windows 2012 R2 hosts, Hyper-V introduced the concept of generation 2 Virtual Machines, which provide various &lt;a href=&#34;https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn282285.aspx&#34;&gt;benefits and a set of restrictions&lt;/a&gt; to those VMs configured in this way. In most cases the performance improvements and functionality they provide make it desirable to create new Virtual Machines as generation 2 -assuming that you will run them on generation 2 capable hosts which at this time of writing is Windows 2012 R2 Servers! Furthermore you will also be restricted by your guest operating system because Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 are not supported by generation 2. There are also further considerations to take into account with regards to Linux support by Hyper-V and we shall look at that topic another time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
