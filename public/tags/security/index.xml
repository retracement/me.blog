      <description>&lt;p&gt;From time to time I get thrown the odd request to provide various bits of information from the SQL Server environment and most recently I was asked about a group of databases that required migrating to another instance. For some reason there had been a little bit of a panic about the impersonation rights in each of the databases and their configuration. The request was &lt;em&gt;*ahem*&lt;/em&gt; kindly passed to me. The number of database users was huge in each database and performing a manual lookup through the SSMS GUI got rather tiresome very quickly (after about the second user).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
