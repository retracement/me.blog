      <description>&lt;p&gt;A little while ago I was talking to someone about possibilities of reporting from SQL Server to avoid impacting the production server and the very first thing that sprang to mind was for them to use snapshotting from a mirror. They had already considered this option but it was not really viable because an almost real-time reporting solution was required. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until later that I wondered whether I had not really been precise enough in my explanation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fairly recently I was talking with a rather talented SQL Specialist internally at Microsoft and was asked the question by him as to where I get my Wait Stat information from. Query tuning isn&amp;rsquo;t really something I currently am required to do on a regular basis so I tend to get my information as and when I need it (even though I have a couple of articles and urls bookmarked I couldn&amp;rsquo;t particularly reference them in a conversation so perhaps I could go one better and officially post them). My answer then was that I Bing for my Wait Stat references (actually replace that with another search engine – but I was on the MS site!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
