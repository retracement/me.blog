      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a very big fan of &lt;em&gt;self-development&lt;/em&gt; materials whether they be books, audio, presentations or simply just ramblings on the Internet and last year during the *Meet an MVP lunch time at the SQL PASS 2010 Summit this was the hotly debated subject on our table.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know these materials generally get a bad press and I always remember a line from one of our comedians here in the UK who was criticising self-improvement training and said &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;the clue is in the name….self! &amp;hellip;so why are you listening to someone else!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. For myself I believe that the &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; in the name self-improvement actually means that we always need to examine ourselves (and our behaviour) in order to grow into something better. One thing that I know for sure is that I have a lot of work ahead of me to become the person that I want to be and I know it is within my power to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I cannot let the week go by without a special goodbye to an old friend. If you hadn&amp;rsquo;t already heard, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.msdn.com/b/sqlreleaseservices/archive/2010/09/29/end-of-support-for-sql-server-7-0.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0&#34;&gt;SQL 7.0 support officially ended on the 11th January&lt;/a&gt; of this week. This means that as of now, legacy installations of SQL Server 7 are threatened with extinction and is only a matter of time before they become as scarce as SQL 6.5 installs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in how I got started with SQL Server and you haven&amp;rsquo;t done so already, you might want to take a quick peek at my &lt;a href=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/about&#34;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; page. Here I mention how I quite insightfully (read luckily) took a training opportunity and put myself on a SQL 7 beta course rather than the one my company was expecting – one for SQL 6.5. That decision had a very big effect on my future IT career. Whilst at the training centre I remember that there was a guy there who claimed that he had been one of the first 100 people in the world to certify as an MCSE+i and his efforts to do so had been made a little easier because of the fact that he had apparently been based in Saudi Arabia for six months in a company that had not only a testing centre but all course materials available to him. He said of being out there &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;well what else can you do for 6 months in Saudi? I thought I might as well do something productive!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Firstly let me wish you all a very happy New Year and secondly a big thank you to all of you who have been dropping by my blog and I sincerely hope you continue to do so. I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing at least a 10% month on month growth in traffic since the start of the year and its the prospect that I might be producing something (however remote) of interest to someone makes my efforts even more rewarding. I would also like to pay my respects to all those other Bloggers in the Blogosphere who provide great content for me to consume – more on this in the next few days. Also lets not forget the Tweeps, and if you do both then a huge big-up to you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
