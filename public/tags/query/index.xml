      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whilst recently working with historic financial data, I ran across a situation that needed an aggregate view of transactional data grouped by a certain set of attributes in order to backfill some missing aggregate data sets. In front of me, I had transactional data from time immemorial along with a series of pre-built (validated) historic aggregates which had been created from a different (but now unknown) process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My mission then, was to understand how this source transactional data must be aggregated so that it could be compared against the sets of pre-built aggregate data. Once I validated the process, I could (re)populate the missing aggregate tables in confidence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
