      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows me well will know that I like to fly my colors close to my chest and am a proud Chelsea fan. I have supported them since they fell to and rose back from the English old Second Division as Champions under the then manager Bobby Campbell, and have seen highs and lows (mostly lows) for the next seven years. That is until Dutch legend Ruud Gullit became the manager in ’96 and bought perhaps the greatest player ever to grace the blue shirt of Chelsea FC.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Having consumed at least one bottle of soda during the night I start on another and then move onto Coffee. There is no keynote today and therefore no rush, so I leisurely get my stuff together and contemplate breakfast. No rush that is until I look to my phone and notice a tweet telling me that the UK community is in the Community Zone at 8am, but given that the time is currently 7:30am I realize that it will be impossible for me to make it in time. I’ve represented this area many times before and am no longer the UK RM, so I excuse myself and let others step up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My session is the last one of the day which means I have just under 14hours to go before completing what I actually came here to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;7 Days of PASS – Day 5&#xA;It’s 3.30am and I have been sleeping off a really bad pain in my stomach (from what I think is a Mango allergy). Having achieved practically nothing the night before, it is important that I manage to put in some serious hours into my session prep. The whole thing is going badly and I’m not happy, but I’ll keep plugging away up until the end. By 6.30am I have progressed a little further, but now it is time I start getting ready for the PASS Keynote in which I am on the Blogger table again. I’m out of my hotel by around 7.30am, so I quickly head to (yes you’ve guessed it) Starbucks at 600 Pine Street and grab a muffin for breakfast as I walk across to the Conference Center.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I started the day pretty much as I ended the previous night, I woke up and immediately started working on my session again! By around 9am I decided that I really ought to head out to breakfast, and went over to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sheratonseattle.com/seattle-daily-grill&#34;&gt;Sheraton Bar and Grill&lt;/a&gt; and proceeded to eat the largest amount of Bacon and Salmon that has ever been consumed in one sitting. The buffet cost me 20 Bucks, but I suspect my Salmon alone cost that much wholesale! Combined with two huge Orange juices and several hogs worth of Bacon, I was not only very happy but very full!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Instead, I will have a day of session preparation ahead of me because I am still behind and seriously need to get this train back on the tracks. I know the day is going to be a fairly solitary event, and so it proves, but I at least struggle to get myself to breakfast at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dragonfishcafe.com/&#34;&gt;Dragonfish Cafe&lt;/a&gt; and have probably the most amazing tasting and crunchy fried potatoes ever -washed down with some eggs and American crispy bacon. One thing I have learnt about the Americans is that they LOVE potatoes and LOVE crispy bacon. But I’m not complaining!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I started the day looking forward to the return of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho&#34;&gt;Mourinho&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)&#34;&gt;Stamford Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, but this time he was leading a different team (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.manutd.com/&#34;&gt;Manchester United&lt;/a&gt;). I was of course hoping for a &lt;a href=&#34;https://https://www.chelseafc.com/&#34;&gt;Chelsea&lt;/a&gt; win, but my biggest challenge was trying to find somewhere to watch the match. My problem was that the game would kick off at 9am (Seattle time), so a sports bar wasn’t possible, so in the end, I found a dodgy streaming site which kind-of did the job. Four-Nil to Chelsea and I was a happy man!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Not good, but at least my cup of tea is slightly more appealing, and I start to get ready for my trip. I have a 30-minute drive ahead of me to the airport, so I start getting ready and head off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Sadness because Karla has not only become a great friend and ally over the years (and I will deeply miss her in doing what she does), but joyous because I know that she is moving on to the next successful phase of her life story -one in which she can rightly reap the rewards of her brilliance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Anouncing Hybrid Virtual Chapter</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is with a tinge of sadness that we announce the Oracle Virtual Chapter is no more, but do not despair, all is not lost!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Around 14 months ago the leadership of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://oracle.sqlpass.org/Home.aspx&#34;&gt;Oracle Virtual Chapter&lt;/a&gt; changed hands after it had laid dormant for approximately the same length of time as from then to now. Back then &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlpass.org/&#34;&gt;PASS&lt;/a&gt; were not entirely convinced that there was an audience or market for this Chapter, but we discussed our vision for it’s future and for a time the VC had a stay of execution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My main session is scheduled to be delivered at 8 a.m so that means I have approximately &lt;em&gt;four hours&lt;/em&gt; to try and nail it. First I get showered at dressed, and then start running through my slide deck and correct error after error. Once I am happy with the deck, I read through my notes and study each slide until I am happy that I &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; each one. I run through the demos and complete main session preparation before returning back to the lightning talk. After working four solid hours I head to the Convention Centre so that I can grab a quick bite to eat and setup in my room with enough lead time before the session starts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This time I am seated at the opposite end of the table to the day before and soon after sitting down I am greeted by Chris Yates (&lt;a href=&#34;https://chrisyatessql.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;web&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/yatessql&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;) who turns out to be a really nice guy and a pleasure to sit with. This time the keynote focuses more on the logistics of PASS growth and their finances more than anything else. After an all too long discussion on those points we finally get to the ever brilliant Dr David DeWitt and Dr Rimma Nehme who talk about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things&#34;&gt;IoT&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll be honest and say that I didn’t find much (personal) value in this discussion but that is probably because I am more interested in technical nitty gritty rather than more generalised discussion, but there is no doubting those two are not only brilliant individuals but are an incredible team together. Sad then that the real stand out announcement of the entire Summit Keynote sessions for me was their shock news that they would not be working together after this Summit due to David retiring and Rimma moving onto other things. The result was a couple of tears in my eyes and a standing ovation from all those present. I’ve been watching these guys present (especially David) since my very first Summit, and this feels like an end of an era to all concerned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I need some breakfast but am running out of time so for the first time ever (out of 6 years of Summit) I decide to drop by the Conference Center and check-out the breakfast offerings. The only thing that I really care about is Bacon and I am pleased to report that the dining hall has a bountiful supply! I grab some Egg, fruit and (of course) Bacon and wonder why I have never done this before??? Could have saved myself hundreds of Bucks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I feel pretty bad from yesterday’s alcoholic Molotov concoctions and have been up since 2.30 a.m. unable to sleep with jet-lag and over exuberance. By the morning I have become an expert on Seattle Weather reports and American News but I’m feeling a little better and am grateful for those few bottles of water in my room. I decide to get in-touch with last nights partners in crime and we arrange to meetup at &lt;a href=&#34;https://eatatlowells.com/&#34;&gt;Lowells&lt;/a&gt; to have some breakfast. This is good for me because I have wanted to try breakfast at Lowells for a long time having only ever eaten there for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Today is the first day of SQLPASS pre-conference sessions although this year is the first time ever in 6 years that I will not be attending them. Instead I’ve decided to leave the days open to do other things and hopefully catch up on some work, so this is what I try to do for the next few hours until my hunger cannot take it any more. I head over to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dailygrill.com/locations/daily-grill-seattle-washington/&#34;&gt;Daily Grill&lt;/a&gt; again for a quick breakfast and coffee and then head across the road to register at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wscc.com/&#34;&gt;Convention Center&lt;/a&gt; to pick up the standard fare and obligatory conference bag.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My body aches, but I’m soaking my bones in a nice hot bath and starting to feel ready for the day. As I glance outside I can see that the darkened streets are glistening from the light rain that is gently falling. The Sun is not completely up and it is cloudy to boot. Welcome to Seattle weather.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Knowing that I had lots of work to do on the plane, I decided that an upgrade to Business Class was in order so upon boarding settled back for that more pampered experience. The flight itself was fairly uneventful and despite spending a couple of hours trying to go through presentation content, I could not resist the lure of the in-flight film system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>So you havent been selected for the PASS Summit?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I guess it could be easy to become complacent about being selected to speak at conferences and you could certainly argue that I have been tremendously lucky with the selection process since I first broke into the speaking circuit in 2010. In 2011 I delivered my first lightning talk at the Summit and this was already off the back of me being the only European speaker (AFAIK) at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlpass.org/sqlrally/2011/orlando/Home.aspx&#34;&gt;SQLRally Orlando&lt;/a&gt;. Every year since then I have been fortunate enough to be selected to deliver one (or more) full session abstracts at the Summit and when combined with a nice collection of speaking gigs at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlsaturday.com/&#34;&gt;SQLSaturdays&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlpass.org/Events/24HoursofPASS.aspx&#34;&gt;24HOP&lt;/a&gt; and other events you could be forgiven for thinking that I must have the &lt;em&gt;magic touch&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in August 2012 I had the honour of speaking at the last (but one) SQLSaturday to be held in New York City which marked a particular milestone in my SQL Server journey. While I had (by then) already spoken at the two American SQLRally events (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlpass.org/sqlrally/2011/orlando/Home.aspx&#34;&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlpass.org/sqlrally/2012/dallas/Home.aspx&#34;&gt;Dallas&lt;/a&gt;) and delivered a lightning talk at the 2011 PASS Summit, SQLSaturday New York was my first ever SQLSaturday in the U.S.A and because of that it was already special before I had even arrived.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

First present to your work colleagues, next move onto User-Groups, then onto bigger events such as SQLSaturdays and then finally (when you are ready) talk at the biggest events in the World such as the PASS Summit (in the U.S.A) or SQLBits (in the U.K).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nearby, just a few blocks away, the now empty Convention Center stands as a shell compared to the hive of activity that it was over the last week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last day of the Summit has been and gone and I feel just a hint of sadness that my time here in Seattle and the U.S.A is almost over but can at least start to think about the end of 2014 and look forward to good things in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was again an overloaded rollercoster of a ride filled with appointments, chance meetings of old friends and most significantly the day I gave my Community Session called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlpass.org/summit/2014/Sessions.aspx#sid7377&#34;&gt;Being Buck Woody&lt;/a&gt; alongside the ever fabulous Buck Woody. I spent the early hours of the morning in deep concentration preparing for this session and even while eating breakfast I had my head down gathering thoughts and listening to some recorded notes. Later on, myself and Buck got together in the speaker room and did a final run through of the deck and both of us were fairly happy with the content and flow of the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>5 Days of PASS - Day 3</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well just when you thought things could not get any busier, along comes Day 3 of the PASS Summit. I started the day on the PASS Blogger Table for the opening Keynote speech of the Summit introduced by Thomas LaRock (the current PASS president). There was a distinct shortage of Australian representatives on the table, which was soon rectified by the arrival of the one an only Rob Farley (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rob_farley&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlblog.com/blogs/rob_farley/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;), who is always amusing to listen to. To my left was one of my favourite German SQL Server experts, the ever happy Oliver Engels who was furiously typing away and in front of me Brent Ozar appeared to be switching backwards and forwards across different media platforms and applications and was no doubt constructing some interesting posts for our consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The key note has just begun and the number of first timers standing up is quite incredible and very large. Thomas LaRock has begun the keynote speech and runs through the board of Directors and then makes a plea for people to stop by the Community Zone and connect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the numbers quoted regarding the number of Chapters, SQLSaturdays and Virtual Chapters is quite staggering and demonstrates the growth of PASS today. The discussion moves to looking back at how our personal careers have grown in the last 5 years, which is interesting  because 5 years ago just pre-dates my first ever Summit, how things have changed for me back then in that time frame.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome folks to the second enthralling instalment of 5 days of PASS! As I am sure is about to become very clear, I type with the knowledge that I have a very busy day ahead with various pieces of preparation to complete. The biggest thing that bothers me is that by the time my PASS related workload ends, so will most of the conference. This is perhaps the biggest downside to being involved in events as something more than just an attendee, since you don’t quite get to relax and do as much with your time that you would normally do and your time doesn’t really feel like your own, however if I didn’t enjoy contributing I wouldn’t do it right?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is nice to be back in Seattle and America after not being able to travel last year so it has been particularly great to catch up with a couple of old friends and ex-colleagues. I actually arrived in the States on Saturday evening (two days ago) where I met up with my good friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://theblobfarm.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;Régis Baccaro&lt;/a&gt; at the Airport, and then later we had a nice meal and drinks with the most excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.solidq.com/rpertusa/home.aspx&#34;&gt;Ruben Pertusa Lopez&lt;/a&gt; and a bunch of other &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.solidq.com/&#34;&gt;SolidQ&lt;/a&gt; guys (at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://http://www.taphousegrill.com/&#34;&gt;Taphouse&lt;/a&gt; -of course).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It really goes against much of what I stand for and is not really what I believe the Community is truly about. My involvement with community efforts, whether they be PASS related or not, are done so because I believe that my input (if required) would be beneficial to the cause that  I am offering to invest my time, efforts and possibly finances into. I am not seeking publicity, nor am I interested in promoting any personal ventures, Companies or other self-serving interests into those efforts. What I &lt;strong&gt;am&lt;/strong&gt; interested in, is that this ‘thing’ we all are part of benefits from my investment, whatever that may be. That is surely the whole purpose of being a volunteer? I volunteer my time and effort to you, so that you can benefit -not me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
