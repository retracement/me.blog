First present to your work colleagues, next move onto User-Groups, then onto bigger events such as SQLSaturdays and then finally (when you are ready) talk at the biggest events in the World such as the PASS Summit (in the U.S.A) or SQLBits (in the U.K).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nearby, just a few blocks away, the now empty Convention Center stands as a shell compared to the hive of activity that it was over the last week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last day of the Summit has been and gone and I feel just a hint of sadness that my time here in Seattle and the U.S.A is almost over but can at least start to think about the end of 2014 and look forward to good things in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was again an overloaded rollercoster of a ride filled with appointments, chance meetings of old friends and most significantly the day I gave my Community Session called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlpass.org/summit/2014/Sessions.aspx#sid7377&#34;&gt;Being Buck Woody&lt;/a&gt; alongside the ever fabulous Buck Woody. I spent the early hours of the morning in deep concentration preparing for this session and even while eating breakfast I had my head down gathering thoughts and listening to some recorded notes. Later on, myself and Buck got together in the speaker room and did a final run through of the deck and both of us were fairly happy with the content and flow of the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>5 Days of PASS - Day 3</title>
      <link>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2014/11/06/5-days-of-pass-day-3/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well just when you thought things could not get any busier, along comes Day 3 of the PASS Summit. I started the day on the PASS Blogger Table for the opening Keynote speech of the Summit introduced by Thomas LaRock (the current PASS president). There was a distinct shortage of Australian representatives on the table, which was soon rectified by the arrival of the one an only Rob Farley (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rob_farley&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlblog.com/blogs/rob_farley/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;), who is always amusing to listen to. To my left was one of my favourite German SQL Server experts, the ever happy Oliver Engels who was furiously typing away and in front of me Brent Ozar appeared to be switching backwards and forwards across different media platforms and applications and was no doubt constructing some interesting posts for our consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>5 days of PASS - Blogger table</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The key note has just begun and the number of first timers standing up is quite incredible and very large. Thomas LaRock has begun the keynote speech and runs through the board of Directors and then makes a plea for people to stop by the Community Zone and connect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of the numbers quoted regarding the number of Chapters, SQLSaturdays and Virtual Chapters is quite staggering and demonstrates the growth of PASS today. The discussion moves to looking back at how our personal careers have grown in the last 5 years, which is interesting  because 5 years ago just pre-dates my first ever Summit, how things have changed for me back then in that time frame.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>5 Days of PASS – Day 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome folks to the second enthralling instalment of 5 days of PASS! As I am sure is about to become very clear, I type with the knowledge that I have a very busy day ahead with various pieces of preparation to complete. The biggest thing that bothers me is that by the time my PASS related workload ends, so will most of the conference. This is perhaps the biggest downside to being involved in events as something more than just an attendee, since you don’t quite get to relax and do as much with your time that you would normally do and your time doesn’t really feel like your own, however if I didn’t enjoy contributing I wouldn’t do it right?!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is nice to be back in Seattle and America after not being able to travel last year so it has been particularly great to catch up with a couple of old friends and ex-colleagues. I actually arrived in the States on Saturday evening (two days ago) where I met up with my good friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://theblobfarm.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;Régis Baccaro&lt;/a&gt; at the Airport, and then later we had a nice meal and drinks with the most excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.solidq.com/rpertusa/home.aspx&#34;&gt;Ruben Pertusa Lopez&lt;/a&gt; and a bunch of other &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.solidq.com/&#34;&gt;SolidQ&lt;/a&gt; guys (at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://http://www.taphousegrill.com/&#34;&gt;Taphouse&lt;/a&gt; -of course).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Who is watching the Watchmen?</title>
      <link>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2014/06/03/who-is-watching-the-watchmen/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/images/2014/smiley.png&#34; alt=&#34;Watchmen&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is funny, but when I first decided to put myself forward for the Nominations Committee this year, I didn’t realize that the whole process would turn into a Campaign for Election. It really goes against much of what I stand for and is not really what I believe the Community is truly about. My involvement with community efforts, whether they be PASS related or not, are done so because I believe that my input (if required) would be beneficial to the cause that  I am offering to invest my time, efforts and possibly finances into. I am not seeking publicity, nor am I interested in promoting any personal ventures, Companies or other self-serving interests into those efforts. What I &lt;strong&gt;am&lt;/strong&gt; interested in, is that this ‘thing’ we all are part of benefits from my investment, whatever that may be. That is surely the whole purpose of being a volunteer? I volunteer my time and effort to you, so that you can benefit -not me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
