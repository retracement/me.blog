      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I guess its been a long time since I have offered you a useful nugget of information or help, so I have decided to haul myself to the keyboard and provide a useful tip that I have been saving for a rainy day. Regular readers to this blog will certainly be no stranger to my positively strong feelings towards Oracle’s VirtualBox and I have been a user of this product for more years than I can remember. The tip I am about to describe will use VirtualBox in the examples but it should be transferable to any virtualisation product that has the ability to shrink back virtual disks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
