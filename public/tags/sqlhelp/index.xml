      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a very big fan of &lt;em&gt;self-development&lt;/em&gt; materials whether they be books, audio, presentations or simply just ramblings on the Internet and last year during the *Meet an MVP lunch time at the SQL PASS 2010 Summit this was the hotly debated subject on our table.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know these materials generally get a bad press and I always remember a line from one of our comedians here in the UK who was criticising self-improvement training and said &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;the clue is in the name….self! &amp;hellip;so why are you listening to someone else!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. For myself I believe that the &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; in the name self-improvement actually means that we always need to examine ourselves (and our behaviour) in order to grow into something better. One thing that I know for sure is that I have a lot of work ahead of me to become the person that I want to be and I know it is within my power to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
