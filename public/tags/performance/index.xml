      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fairly recently I was talking with a rather talented SQL Specialist internally at Microsoft and was asked the question by him as to where I get my Wait Stat information from. Query tuning isn&amp;rsquo;t really something I currently am required to do on a regular basis so I tend to get my information as and when I need it (even though I have a couple of articles and urls bookmarked I couldn&amp;rsquo;t particularly reference them in a conversation so perhaps I could go one better and officially post them). My answer then was that I Bing for my Wait Stat references (actually replace that with another search engine – but I was on the MS site!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
