      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/images/2016/warhol_smaller.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Warhol&#34;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this mini-series of posts, we will discuss how the mechanics of SQL Server&amp;rsquo;s transaction logging work to provide transactional durability. We will look at how Delayed Durability changes the logging landscape and then we will specifically see how In-Memory OLTP logging builds upon the on-disk logging mechanism. Finally, we will pose the question &lt;em&gt;should we use Delayed Durability with In-Memory or not&lt;/em&gt; and discuss this scenario in detail. But in order to understand how delayed durability works, it is first important for us to understand how the transaction log works -so we shall start there&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fairly recently I was talking with a rather talented SQL Specialist internally at Microsoft and was asked the question by him as to where I get my Wait Stat information from. Query tuning isn&amp;rsquo;t really something I currently am required to do on a regular basis so I tend to get my information as and when I need it (even though I have a couple of articles and urls bookmarked I couldn&amp;rsquo;t particularly reference them in a conversation so perhaps I could go one better and officially post them). My answer then was that I Bing for my Wait Stat references (actually replace that with another search engine – but I was on the MS site!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
