      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was just recently going through my old SQL Server documents and reference material and attempting to organize and tidy things up, when I re-discovered a huge collection of literature that even now is incredibly useful. The only problem is that many of these old electronic books and files are stored in &lt;em&gt;CHM&lt;/em&gt; format. Those old timers of you will remember that this was how SQL Server Books online was deployed up to and including SQL Server 2000.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Inside-SQL-Server-Query-Optimizer/dp/1906434603&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/images/2011/insidequerysmall.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Inside the SQL Server Query Optimizer&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are only a handful of people that when they talk about something you should sit up and take notice, and for me Benjamin Nevarez (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.benjaminnevarez.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/BenjaminNevarez&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;) is one of those. As someone I&amp;rsquo;ve been following technically for several years, when I saw that his book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Inside-SQL-Server-Query-Optimizer/dp/1906434603&#34;&gt;Inside the SQL Server Query Optimizer&lt;/a&gt; had been released to the Kindle format, I immediately clicked the purchase button and I haven&amp;rsquo;t been disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
