      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to jump straight to the condensed solution, then please feel free to go to the &lt;a href=&#34;#condensed-installation&#34;&gt;Condensed Installation instructions&lt;/a&gt; below. If you find this post useful or have any feedback then please leave me a comment so that I know my efforts were not wasted!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Installing Microsoft Backoffice products on Microsoft Operating Systems has over the years become a much easier proposition and is largely the reason why SQL Server got the reputation of being “easy”. Except it isn’t. Ask any idiot to install a SQL Server instance and create a database and there is a good chance that they will succeed, but ask them to install SQL Server correctly and configured to best practice, suddenly the knowledge gap becomes a little more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
