        <p>I am almost ashamed to say that I have let over a month pass since my last post and truth be told I have come close a few times without never actually pressing that submit button.</p>
<p>I shan’t bore you with my excuses or reasons for my inactivity but what matters is I’m back!</p>
<p>I’ve been seeing an increasing amount of noise about <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org/sqlrally/2012/dallas/">SQLRally Dallas</a> and I felt that I wanted to share my own personal experience with you about this rather unique event (in Orlando) -for it quite literary changed my life.</p>
<p>Six years or so ago I joined a company with big hopes and promises and after starting a small family (and growing it further after joining) I was looking for a period of stability and a platform to learn, improve and share my skills. In short, I knew that come what may, as good or bad as things might get, I was there for the long haul.</p>
<p>Not long after joining, my skills and talent for other technologies were recognised and when the need for a specialized “crack” team supporting a critical troublesome in-house application, I was identified as their man. This position (I was told) would be permanent and was absolutely vital to the running of the company operation. There was one small problem -I didn’t want it and regretfully declined. My reasons were many but I had joined the company as a SQL Server SME and saw the very broad set of skills required to support one single application platform as a regression in my ever growing expertise in SQL Server (and increasing knowledge in Oracle) and did my best to explain this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, the Technical Director at the time (let’s give him a fictitious name of Dennis) told me in no uncertain terms that this would be the last time I ever refused him. Three months into my new job, everything had turned sour overnight simply due to me being good at what I do.</p>
<p>Years would pass and with each new year would bring a new job offer somewhere else for an ever increasing Salary, but I would always find a reason not to take it -probably the thought of repeating the same mistakes again was always the biggest reason to avoid saying yes.</p>
<p>Then something happened.</p>
<p>Although I have been helping in forums and the like on and off for a long period of time which you can read a little more about in this post (<a href="todo:http://tenbulls.co.uk/2011/08/01/standing-upon-the-shoulders-of-giants/">Standing upon the shoulders of Giants</a>) I always felt that I had more to give, more to share, more to say and more to learn. I decided to submit my first ever public presentation to <a href="http://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event7/Thinking_outside_the_Box_Learning_a_little_about_a_lot">SQLBits 7</a> and surprisingly managed to secure a speaking slot! As daunting as the whole thing was, I think I managed to pull it off -and if nothing else I know that I learned LOADS during my weeks and weeks of hard graft of preparation putting it all together.</p>
<p>About a month or so later I took a week off work and self-financed a trip to the <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org/summit/na2010/">SQLPASS 2010 Summit</a> (my very first time) and met some absolutely amazingly talented people which is probably another story for another time.</p>
<p>Whilst in Seattle I decided that should the opportunity arise, I wanted to attempt a presentation in America and would submit and hope for the best. <a href="http://www.sqlpass.org/sqlrally/2011/orlando/">SQLRally Orlando</a> was announced and my submissions went in. Although I didn’t make the first cut, my submission received the joint highest votes for the runners up and quite incredibly I was eventually selected as a wildcard! Totally brilliant and I was thrilled!</p>
<p>This time (unlike Seattle) I thought I would approach Dennis and see if my company would like to contribute in any way since there would be obvious technical benefits to the organization. The response did not surprise me. He said that my speaking and attending sessions at SQLRally (or anywhere else) had absolutely no benefit to the company at all. I have never forgotten the impact that sentence made upon me. The situation was made even more ironic when a few days later I was assigned to an important scalability project (for someone had personally requested that I should be the resource).</p>
<p>…… The title of my presentation : &ldquo;<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/retracement/orders-ofmagnitudescaleoutyoursqlserverdataslideshare">Orders of magnitude-Scaling your SQL Server Data</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Like the SQLPASS Summit, I fully financed my trip to SQLRally and used a week of my holiday entitlement and came to a decision. I realised that however much I tried to improve myself socially and technically (and help others), Dennis would never support my efforts in any way. A few days later I received a permanent job offer from another firm offering a substantial salary increase (almost double) and I&hellip;.. turned it down!</p>
<p>SQLRally helped me realize that the only person holding me back was myself and It was time for me make the jump. I quit and left for Orlando to give my presentation. On my return, I secured work and now when I need to finance any speaking or training events, the only person I need to convince is myself.</p>
<p>But what of SQLRally? I loved giving my presentation, it was very hard work preparing for it but I learned more than I can put into words at hopefully managed to communicate some of that knowledge across. From a non-speaking perspective, if you have never been to a SQL Server event and can get to Dallas then you are going to LOVE it. SQLRally is smaller than the Summit and full of lots of first timers and many regulars who will embrace you and make you feel completely at home.</p>
<p>Attending SQLRally could be your first steps towards something amazing. I hope you take them, and if you do, I look forward to meeting you someday soon and hopefully share a nice cold beer.</p>

<p>Dennis, I think you made a mistake with me but I know you would never be able to admit it. I sincerely thank you for every single day I spent praying for deliverance. You made me realize that if I wanted something strong enough I could go out there and get it. Through your neglect, you encouraged me to meet people LIKE me. You have given me hope and for that, I will never forget you.</p>
