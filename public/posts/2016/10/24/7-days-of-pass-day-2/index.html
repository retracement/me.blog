<p>After arriving the day before, the threat of jetlag was always going to be there, but I thankfully managed to sleep until 4am and snoozed for a further hour. I started the day looking forward to the return of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mourinho">Mourinho</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)">Stamford Bridge</a>, but this time he was leading a different team (<a href="https://www.manutd.com/">Manchester United</a>). I was of course hoping for a <a href="https://https://www.chelseafc.com/">Chelsea</a> win, but my biggest challenge was trying to find somewhere to watch the match. My problem was that the game would kick off at 9am (Seattle time), so a sports bar wasn&rsquo;t possible, so in the end, I found a dodgy streaming site which kind-of did the job. Four-Nil to Chelsea and I was a happy man!</p>
<p>Shortly after the game had finished, I met up with Craig Ottley-Thistlethwaite (<a href="https://craigot.blogspot.com/">b</a>|<a href="https://twitter.com/craig_ottley">t</a>) and Richard Douglas (<a href="https://sql.richarddouglas.co.uk/">b</a>|<a href="https://twitter.com/sqlrich">t</a>) again and we headed down to the <a href="https://www.centurylinkfield.com/">CenturyLink Field</a> stadium in order to see the <a href="https://www.soundersfc.com/">Seattle Sounders</a> game. In a strange piece of coincidence, this was against the exact same opponents as last year (<a href="https://www.rsl.com/">Real Salt Lake</a>), so I was expecting a similar result. Before we hit the game, we checked into the <a href="https://www.elysianbrewing.com/elysian-bar/">Elysian Fields bar</a> for a swift half and then promptly headed to our seats. While there was not enough <em>playing the ball</em> by both teams and too much lumping it in the air, I still enjoyed another Sounders win -this time 2-1 to the hosts.</p>

<p>During our walk home from the match, we stopped off at <a href="https://www.undergroundtour.com/about/dining.html">Doc Maynard&rsquo;s Public House</a> (the location of the <a href="https://http://www.undergroundtour.com/">Seattle Underground tour</a>) to wash down the match beers with some Seattle Dry Cider. After Craig demonstrated his drinking credentials, we then headed back into Pike for our obligatory visit to the <a href="https://taphousegrill.com/">Tap House</a> to grab some food and drink before I headed back to my room. Within minutes I promptly collapsed in an exhausted heap on my bed as the effects of a pseudo Snake-Bite took hold of my body.</p>
<p>Just another day in Seattle!</p>
