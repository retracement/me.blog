<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve finally made the shift to my new statically generated blog and am slowly migrating the content over. This operation is probably going to take me quite some time since I will need to go all the way back to 2009 and decide what posts and content I want to come across. There is possibly over a hundred posts (or more) to bring across! I&rsquo;ll also be quite keen on bringing over some of my more useful resources (although they may need a huge revamp/ update) such as my Ultimate Resources Training Page and others.</p>
<p>I confess I am still struggling to get up to speed with Hugo (the tool I use for static generation) and find certain missing features mildly frustrating (mainly because I do not know yet how to implement them), however, I am sure over time I can build out my blog to a level of functionality of what it was. On the positive, all my posts are now generated from my preferred language of choice (markdown) and more importantly I am no longer at the mercy of Wordpress.com and their insane pricing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still playing around with Hugo Themes but have settled on a basic minimalistic theme that I think works well - but I still want to add a few more graphics to provide a bit more visual sugar to my readers than my chosen theme provides. Still investigating this!</p>
<p>In my last post I alluded to the fact that I was moving away from my well-established domain name of <a href="http://tenbulls.co.uk">http://tenbulls.co.uk</a> and had let that domain name lapse to the point it was virtually on the point of deletion. After lots of reflection and a realisation that this domain name is referenced in at least four possibly five books that I have been a technical editor or reviewer for, I decided that this was perhaps a very bad idea in the grand scheme of things. The domain renewal fees are trivial, and it was just the domain mapping/ Wordpress Premium that had really been costing the Lion’s share of the costs. It was touch and go for a while whether I could get it back, but after paying a rather large one-off fee to transfer the domain back into my name we were back in business.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forwards to getting back to blogging and sharing my technical insights where I can (or at least documenting technical reminders for myself).</p>
<p>Wish me luck.</p>
