        <p>Just a quick note to give an update on the future changes for this blog. Many long time readers out there might realise that what you are reading today no longer exists under its original domain and currently lives under its default WordPress domain namespace. Given that this blog has existed since 2009 and been linked to from a variety of popular sources and published materials, this is a big shift.</p>
<p>For the last couple of years I have been dealing with a few personal situations and have been unable to blog. This has coincided with a variety of other activities and associations that also needed to be dropped (more on all this another time). However even as far back as then, I had plans to move away from WordPress.</p>
<p>My original intention was simply to migrate all content across from WordPress and statically generate this whilst still retaining my original domain (after all the blog was very well established). Ultimately came to the conclusion that I should instead transfer under my well known social media pseudonym allowing myself to save costs in maintaining excessive domain costs.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, this blog is likely to transfer over the next two to four weeks (at most) where I will slowly move across (and rewrite as required) all content. Legacy and out of date content will be moved across unedited for posterity -although some content will be discarded where it holds no technical value or no historical purpose.</p>
<p>I have some big plans in 2025, and some of which I will be unable to discuss further until they actually happen, however I promise that once migration has completed, I will increase my blogging output back to its glory days.</p>
