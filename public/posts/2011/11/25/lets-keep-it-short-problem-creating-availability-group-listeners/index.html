        <p>Someone once said to me that he thought I should work as a GUI tester since I always seemed to find problems in the UI -after I had highlighted a problem to him that I&rsquo;d found in Linux Gnome which he had never seen before <em>&ldquo;after all his years working with the product&rdquo;</em>. I guess there is an element of truth to that statement since I really do like clicking around and trying different things. However I suspect that my latest discovery won&rsquo;t necessarily be one of those obscure problems that no-one else comes across since it is such an obvious problem and fairly easy to run into.</p>
<p>Whilst playing around with SQL Server 2012 (Denali) Availability groups, I discovered that there is a restriction set on the size of the listener name that you are able to enter through the GUI.</p>
<p>Let me demonstrate&hellip;</p>
<p>First I will create a new DNS host name called <em>readpastandfurious</em> which you should note is 18 characters long.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2011/createdns.png" alt="Create new A record"><br/>
<em>Create our &ldquo;longish&rdquo; DNS host record</em></p>
<p>And of course there isn&rsquo;t a problem creating this record since the restriction upon the size of the DNS host name is (I believe 24 characters).</p>
<p><img src="/images/2011/dnscreated.png" alt="DNS record created"><br/>
<em>DNS Server will now resolve our host record</em></p>
<p>Next I decide to create an Availability Group Listener via the SSMS GUI wizard and am very surprised when I can only type in 15 characters! Obviously this text field must have been programmatically restricted since by default the GUI text fields would not be limited.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2011/dialogbox.png" alt="Run out of characters"><br/>
<em>Oh dear we are out of characters</em></p>
<p>My first thought was that it has been restricted on purpose perhaps for an odd NETBIOS reason -if for example NETBIOS was being used for resolution in any way in addition to DNS (daft but possible). Microsoft limits NETBIOS names to 15 characters, so this might have been a plausible explanation.</p>
<p>Next I decide to try and create the full 18 character availability group via T-SQL and I am a little surprised to find that it succeeded with no problems at all!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">ALTER</span> AVAILABILITY <span style="color:#66d9ef">GROUP</span> [READPAST <span style="color:#f92672">&amp;</span>amp; Furious Optimistic]
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">ADD</span> LISTENER <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;readpastandfurious&#39;</span> (<span style="color:#66d9ef">WITH</span> IP ( (<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;10.0.5.1&#39;</span>,<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;255.0.0.0&#39;</span>) ) )
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="/images/2011/queryworks.png" alt="Successful create through T-SQL">
<em>&hellip;but as I suspected, via TSQL is hunky dory</em>**</p>
<hr>
<p>My conclusion then is that this behaviour is almost certainly a bug and was introduced by a programmer who either doesn&rsquo;t understand the difference between NETBIOS and DNS or blindly assumed that 15 characters is enough?! In any event I believe this is a problem and have therefore raised a connect item for this issue <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/708320/availability-group-listener-restricted-to-15-char-via-the-gui">here</a> give it a vote up if you believe you might fall prey to this issue at some point in the future!</p>
