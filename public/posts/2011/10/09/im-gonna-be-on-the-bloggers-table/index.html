        <p>So I&rsquo;m currently sat here in the lounge of the <a href="https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/seasi-sheraton-grand-seattle/overview/">Seattle Sheraton</a> and finally have time to reflect upon my week ahead here at this years <a href="https://www.sqlpass.org/summit/2011/">SQLPASS Summit</a>. At this point in time it is very hard to say exactly how busy I am going to be this week but I suspect that my time here will be slightly more focused than last time since I have a few more responsibilities than before.</p>
<p>So my first official appointment will happen on Tuesday evening when I hope to meet and great my <a href="https://www.sqlpass.org/summit/2011/Connect/FirstTimers.aspx">SQLPASS first timers</a> having signed myself up to be a &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; to all those people that have never visited the Summit before. I really expect to learn a lot myself from this experience and if nothing else hope to learn some insights into becoming a better Big Brother for future conferences. I already have some ideas in this area, so for now I shall try and absorb what I can with this in mind.</p>
<p>Following this meeting (and the Welcome reception) I will be joining the PASS Speaker and Volunteer party and should be really fun to meet the people that are helping to make this conference actually happen. Some of which I know and many I don&rsquo;t, so I am really looking forward to this event. It is just a shame that it has been arranged for the same night of my first timer reception and I have raised this point with the PASS organizers to try and avoid this same thing happening again.</p>
<p>Then on the Wednesday morning I am truly excited about being on the SQLPASS bloggers table. At this stage I am not entirely sure what this will entail and what exactly I will be doing there, but I presume that at the very least I shall be live blogging and tweeting about the SQLPASS Summit and the goings on around me. Should be good!</p>
<p>Finally on the Friday I will be giving my Lightning talk <a href="https://www.sqlpass.org/summit/2011/Speakers/CallForSpeakers/SessionDetail.aspx?sid=2125">SQL Server Clustering for Clustering for Dummies</a> which should be a really fun thing to do. I really need to figure out what I am going to say and it is really going to be a challenge to cram one hours worth of material into 5 minutes but I am up for this challenge!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s me for now, and all that there is left to say is that if you know me, know of me or want to know me (more fool you) then I really hope you come up and say hello and perhaps join me for a beer or two one evening!</p>
