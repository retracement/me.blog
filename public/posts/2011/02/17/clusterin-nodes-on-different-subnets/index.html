        <p>It&rsquo;s rather ironic that the answer to a question that came my way recently, had been sitting in my feed-reader for the last month. Apart from the length of time that the item/s had been sitting there, I had opened them on numerous occasions and re-marked as <em>unread</em> because I believed they needed more than just a quick skim.</p>
<p>I consider myself very experienced with SQL Clustering but one cannot know everything about everything. I&rsquo;m endeavouring to fill any gaps in order to be not just very good, but hopefully at some point a leading (or how about <em>the leading</em> expert in this field.

<em>NO these are not the kind of clusters we are talkin&rsquo; about!</em></p>
<p>Anyway, with respect to the question I am rather pleased it got asked, because it focused my attention to the two articles sitting in my feed-reader and although I may have digested them at some point I wonder whether the details would have stuck. Now those details have relevance to me and I doubt I shall ever forget. The question is &ldquo;Can cluster nodes reside on different subnets?&rdquo; -and this question was basically asked in the context of talking about Geo-Clusters. My answer was <em>no they can&rsquo;t, the nodes of a cluster must reside on the same subnet and to get around this problem on a Geo-Cluster a V-LAN needs to be created</em>. For now, lets not worry about Geo-Clusters for a minute to avoid overcomplicating things, so before you continue onto the links what do you think the answer is and why?</p>

<p>And now you&rsquo;ve checked, tell me&hellip;. <em>did you get it right?</em></p>
