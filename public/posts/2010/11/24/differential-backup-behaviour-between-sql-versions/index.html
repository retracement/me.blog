        <p>The other day I ran into a rather unique problem with a database when attempting to maintain it&rsquo;s transaction log. As it turned out my particular issue was related to old replication code -which I hope to post about at a later date, but essentially I needed to clear down some of the logfile&rsquo;s VLFs which I was struggling to perform. Anything I attempted to maintain it failed, however if I performed Transactional log backups, they would also fail due to the fact that there was no Full database backup in existence. Since the database was huge, and a full backup would have taken up to 12 hours to perform, it raised quite an interesting question namely <em>was there a way to force a Transactional log backup</em>?</p>
<p>My good friend Allen Dunn came up with the idea of taking a Differential backup first instead, but I had already tried this. However Alan insisted that it did work and upon questioning him further it transpired that he was doing so on a SQL 2005 server.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2010/twitterwithalan.png" alt="Twitter with Alan"></p>
<p>I was particularly interested since I was convinced that I had observed this exact same behaviour on that platform as well several years back, so I decided to run some tests. Below you will see the T-SQL code that I scrambled together to test, but essentially the test would first attempt a Differential backup on a new database (that obviously would not have a Full backup) and then followed the test up with a Transactional log backup on a new database. I was surprised to find that the behaviour does indeed differ between SQL 2005 and 2008.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you will see below the screen shot of the results from the SQL 2008 server did confirm exactly what I had experienced that not only the Differential backups require a full backup to have been taken, but also the Transactional log backups do too. I think this behaviour is understandable for normal operations on the basis that either backup without a corresponding <em>FULL</em> would essentially be useless for recovery purposes:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why the ability to take Differentials on databases that haven&rsquo;t had a Full backup taken first (SQL 2008) has been removed or whether it being allowed in SQL 2005 was an oversight for that release. Personally I do not like this kind of &ldquo;Nanny&rdquo; style computing in restricting our actions because I believe that by forcing us down one resolution route hinders our ability to make an informed judgement to take another course of action. Going back to my initial problem that I touched upon at the beginning, I believe that had the transaction log backups been allowed to run they probably still wouldn&rsquo;t have resolved my problem with the VLF&rsquo;s, but what this would have done is shown me very early on that something else was <em>fundamentally wrong</em> in the database configuration and therefore arrived at a solution faster than I did.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> For important databases you should always try to guarantee that you are able to meet your RPO, this means always having a Full backup and any relevant Differential with respective Transaction log backups (depending upon your SLA and RPO). What this means to YOU as a DBA is to AVOID performing any operation that will break this chain!</p>
