        <p>Today I spent a very entertaining 4 hours or so, finally taking (after 4 years of getting around to it) the SQL 2005 upgrade exam and had a bit of a &lsquo;mare. My first problem with this exam was that it started off with 7 or 8 mini-exams and these were essentially very large case studies that each had 5-8 questions attached. Now my first problem was that I must have spent the first 8 minutes of my allocated 15 for this one case study trying to figure out where the first question was! The number was displaying 1/8, however clicking the <em>&ldquo;Question&rdquo;</em> button simply didn&rsquo;t change anything and I was left with the explanation of how to do these mini exams. Finally after coming across some text somewhere I realised that question 1 was in fact not a question but an introduction!!!! Was it beyond the wit of man to not start the question numbering post introduction?</p>
<p>Anyway, so now I&rsquo;m motoring through and we are all good again, until I nearly get to the end of one of the latter questions and clicking <em>&ldquo;Next&rdquo;</em> no longer moves me to the next question any more. Worse than that, <em>&ldquo;Previous&rdquo;</em> doesn&rsquo;t work either. All the other buttons work, but not the one I want. No one at the test centre had a clue either and eventually the time ran out on the mini-test and I missed the chance to answer that question.</p>
<p>I spent the remainder of the exam trying to stay focused and calm but it was flipping difficult I can tell you!</p>
<p>Thankfully I still passed this upgrade exam with flying colours, so now I will look to take my upgrade to the SQL 2008 certification as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I prey this one is less eventful&hellip;</p>
