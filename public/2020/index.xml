      <title>SSIS Data Flow Performance Tuning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes before you say it, I know SQL Server Integration Services is “old technology” but a lot of people are still using it, and in many cases are either still developing against it, or are looking to integrate/ migrate with other burgeoning technologies such as Azure Data Factory. In other words, if you are not currently using SSIS then this post is probably not for you -otherwise read on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are still one of the lucky ones to still be using SSIS, I thought it would be worth publishing these comprehensive notes taken from a session titled “SSIS Data Flow Performance Tuning” delivered at SQLBits 8 (Brighton) by the then “SSIS guru” Jamie Thomson. Notes have timings (in mins and seconds) against them, which correlate directly with the presentation times. The video is still available and can be downloaded from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event8/SSIS_Dataflow_Performance_tuning&#34;&gt;SQLBits website&lt;/a&gt; so you can watch it (if required) and use the timings to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Querying Azure Vm State With Powershell</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently given the task of identifying the state of an Azure VM so that an automation script using the &lt;code&gt;az vm run-command invoke&lt;/code&gt; would not fail if the VM was down or under a reboot.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I initially thought the task would be really easy and a simple query of the VM state using &lt;code&gt;Get-AzVM&lt;/code&gt; would provide us with a running state property of the VM, but as it happens the state is a little abstracted.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Removing and Maintaining Azure Resource Group Deployments Based Upon Deployment Count</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever you create or update an Azure resource, a new &lt;em&gt;deployment&lt;/em&gt; is created under the resources’ configured resource group. This deployment history is retained ad-infinitum until you eventually hit the hard limit of &lt;em&gt;800 deployments (per resource group)&lt;/em&gt;. You may think this figure is more than enough to accommodate all the possible resource changes that could ever be made in a resource group, but if you are running CICD pipelines to push out your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) (or create lots of resources per resource group) then it is very likely you will exhaust this figure very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Inconsistent result sets and another case against pessimistic isolation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of demonstrating when transaction processing goes bad in Database Management Systems because it is a reminder to us all to ensure that we know exactly what we are doing when we write our code. Not only should you test and execute your code multiple times in serial (for instance running in sequence in isolation), but you should also execute in parallel with itself or other potentially dependent transactions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Restore Azure Devops Repository</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/2020/04/14/restore-azure-devops-repository/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are using &lt;a href=&#34;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/&#34;&gt;Azure DevOps&lt;/a&gt;, you might be comforted that your &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/&#34;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; repo is “in the Cloud” and automatically has availability and disaster guarantees. However you (or someone else) still have the ability to accidentally (or maliciously) delete repos from Azure DevOps Repos. Surprisingly, at the time of writing, there is no GUI based option to restore your repo. This might initially instill a sense of panic as you frantically search for the latest local clone to replace your remote – but there is a better way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cannot delete old build definitions in Azure DevOps</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been experiencing a problem for quite a while now in my current environment, in that some of our old builds cannot be deleted. When you attempt to do so it results in the following error:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/2020/cannotdel.webp&#34; alt=&#34;build error&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One or more builds associated with the requested pipeline(s) are retained by a release. The pipeline(s) and builds will not be deleted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of our pipelines have undergone a lot of change over time to the degree it is not even obvious anymore why (or indeed where) these builds are being prevented from being dropped. The only thing that is clear is that until they can be, the old build definitions will remain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Querying Azure Devops Rest Api With Powershell</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/2020/saddog.png&#34; alt=&#34;sad dog&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In previous posts we have talked about trying to use and consume Azure DevOps using PowerShell and utilizing the Azure CLI. In particular, my post titled Use &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/2020/02/17/use-powershell-to-consume-your-azure-cli-devops-result-set.md&#34;&gt;PowerShell to consume your Azure CLI DevOps result&lt;/a&gt; set painted a rather frustrating picture when trying to manipulate the tabular dataset from the Azure CLI. Furthermore, our functionality is restricted to only those commands implemented by the Azure CLI Azure DevOps add-in -as will become increasingly obvious, this is limited to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
