    <h2><a href="/posts/2025/04/06/blog-update/">Restart of blog</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/images/2025/restart-plane-ai-600.png" alt="Restarting"></p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve finally made the shift to my new statically generated blog and am slowly migrating the content over. This operation is probably going to take me quite some time since I will need to go all the way back to 2009 and decide what posts and content I want to come across. There is possibly over a hundred posts (or more) to bring across! I&rsquo;ll also be quite keen on bringing over some of my more useful resources (although they may need a huge revamp/ update) such as my Ultimate Resources Training Page and others.</p>

    <h2><a href="/posts/2025/02/01/future-changes/">Future Changes</a></h2>
    <p>Just a quick note to give an update on the future changes for this blog. Many long time readers out there might realise that what you are reading today no longer exists under its original domain and currently lives under its default WordPress domain namespace. Given that this blog has existed since 2009 and been linked to from a variety of popular sources and published materials, this is a big shift.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2023/06/18/automating-pause-of-synapse-dedicated-pool-part-i/">Automating Pause of Synapse Dedicated Pool Part I</a></h2>
    <p>Synapse Analytics is an enterprise analytics engine that offers multiple (compute) Pool types that you can use for varying data processing and analytics requirements. Each Pool type has a slightly different cost model based upon its architecture, capabilities, and consumption patterns, but if we over simplify things, we can break these cost considerations down to compute costs and (in some cases) storage costs.</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits with modern data lakehouse architectures is that with the separation of compute and storage comes the ability to reduce costs when compute is not needed, and most importantly, not running.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2023/01/31/why-is-my-azure-solution-running-slow/">Why Is My Azure Solution Running Slow</a></h2>
    <p>As an Azure data professional, one of the most common questions you are most likely to hear from users is “why do cloud solutions often appear to have performance issues post-deployment“. This perception is particularly common for Azure migration projects moving on-premises into the cloud, but do these observations really match reality or are they misguided?</p>
<p>In this introductory article, we will take a look into some of the reasons why Azure cloud-based solutions are often seen to be problematic, or in some cases, are problematic, and provide some ideas to avoid these negative perceptions in your cloud environment.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2022/09/01/encouraging-diversity-in-leadership-roles/">Encouraging Diversity in Leadership Roles</a></h2>
    <p>Over 33 years ago I started my journey working in Information Technology (I.T.), and it is probably fair to say that I have worked my way slowly up from the absolute bottom of the pile to the modest heights of today.</p>
<h1 id="the-problem-with-it">The problem with I.T.</h1>
<p>As I look back over the years I cannot help but feel a sense of disappointment that during my long and arduous journey to the “top” I never really found someone of seniority (or power) who went out of their way to selflessly help me climb the greasy ladder of success in any of the organisations I worked at. I don’t think my experiences are particularly unique either.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2022/07/29/a-quick-introduction-to-azure-purview/">A Quick Introduction to Azure Purview</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/images/2022/catalogue-of-data-ai-600.png" alt="Data Catalog"></p>
<p>Azure Purview is Microsoft’s next-generation data catalog service in Azure which is a direct replacement for the first-generation service known as Azure Data Catalog. While some people refer to Purview as Azure Data Catalog v2, It is important to note that Purview is more of a re-write of Azure Data Catalog rather than an upgrade, and as such, no migration path between both services currently exists.</p>
<p>Azure Purview can be used to inventory, classify, map, and govern your on-premises, multi-cloud, and SaaS data estate, providing a holistic up-to-date map of your data with automatic data discovery, data classification, and end-to-end data lineage.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2020/08/11/ssis-performance/">SSIS Data Flow Performance Tuning</a></h2>
    <p>Yes before you say it, I know SQL Server Integration Services is “old technology” but a lot of people are still using it, and in many cases are either still developing against it, or are looking to integrate/ migrate with other burgeoning technologies such as Azure Data Factory. In other words, if you are not currently using SSIS then this post is probably not for you -otherwise read on.</p>
<p>If you are still one of the lucky ones to still be using SSIS, I thought it would be worth publishing these comprehensive notes taken from a session titled “SSIS Data Flow Performance Tuning” delivered at SQLBits 8 (Brighton) by the then “SSIS guru” Jamie Thomson. Notes have timings (in mins and seconds) against them, which correlate directly with the presentation times. The video is still available and can be downloaded from the <a href="https://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event8/SSIS_Dataflow_Performance_tuning">SQLBits website</a> so you can watch it (if required) and use the timings to follow along.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2020/05/12/querying-azure-vm-state-with-powershell/">Querying Azure Vm State With Powershell</a></h2>
    <p>I was recently given the task of identifying the state of an Azure VM so that an automation script using the <code>az vm run-command invoke</code> would not fail if the VM was down or under a reboot.</p>
<p>I initially thought the task would be really easy and a simple query of the VM state using <code>Get-AzVM</code> would provide us with a running state property of the VM, but as it happens the state is a little abstracted.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2020/05/06/removing-and-maintaining-azure-resource-group-deployments-based-upon-deployment-count/">Removing and Maintaining Azure Resource Group Deployments Based Upon Deployment Count</a></h2>
    <p>Whenever you create or update an Azure resource, a new <em>deployment</em> is created under the resources’ configured resource group. This deployment history is retained ad-infinitum until you eventually hit the hard limit of <em>800 deployments (per resource group)</em>. You may think this figure is more than enough to accommodate all the possible resource changes that could ever be made in a resource group, but if you are running CICD pipelines to push out your Infrastructure as Code (IaC) (or create lots of resources per resource group) then it is very likely you will exhaust this figure very quickly.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2020/04/27/inconsistent-results/">Inconsistent result sets and another case against pessimistic isolation</a></h2>
    <p>I’m a big fan of demonstrating when transaction processing goes bad in Database Management Systems because it is a reminder to us all to ensure that we know exactly what we are doing when we write our code. Not only should you test and execute your code multiple times in serial (for instance running in sequence in isolation), but you should also execute in parallel with itself or other potentially dependent transactions.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2020/04/14/restore-azure-devops-repository/">Restore Azure Devops Repository</a></h2>
    <p>If you are using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/">Azure DevOps</a>, you might be comforted that your <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> repo is “in the Cloud” and automatically has availability and disaster guarantees. However you (or someone else) still have the ability to accidentally (or maliciously) delete repos from Azure DevOps Repos. Surprisingly, at the time of writing, there is no GUI based option to restore your repo. This might initially instill a sense of panic as you frantically search for the latest local clone to replace your remote – but there is a better way.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2020/03/25/delete-old-build-definitions-in-azure-devops/">Cannot delete old build definitions in Azure DevOps</a></h2>
    <p>I have been experiencing a problem for quite a while now in my current environment, in that some of our old builds cannot be deleted. When you attempt to do so it results in the following error:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2020/cannotdel.webp" alt="build error"></p>
<p><em>One or more builds associated with the requested pipeline(s) are retained by a release. The pipeline(s) and builds will not be deleted.</em></p>
<p>Many of our pipelines have undergone a lot of change over time to the degree it is not even obvious anymore why (or indeed where) these builds are being prevented from being dropped. The only thing that is clear is that until they can be, the old build definitions will remain.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2020/03/11/querying-azure-devops-rest-api-with-powershell/">Querying Azure Devops Rest Api With Powershell</a></h2>
    <p><img src="/images/2020/saddog.png" alt="sad dog"></p>
<p>In previous posts we have talked about trying to use and consume Azure DevOps using PowerShell and utilizing the Azure CLI. In particular, my post titled Use <a href="/posts/2020/02/17/use-powershell-to-consume-your-azure-cli-devops-result-set.md">PowerShell to consume your Azure CLI DevOps result</a> set painted a rather frustrating picture when trying to manipulate the tabular dataset from the Azure CLI. Furthermore, our functionality is restricted to only those commands implemented by the Azure CLI Azure DevOps add-in -as will become increasingly obvious, this is limited to say the least.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2020/02/25/dropbox-appears-stuck-synchronizing-files/">Dropbox Appears Stuck Synchronizing Files</a></h2>
    <p>Normally I don’t like off-topic style posts, and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> is certainly not within my key areas of interest, however, I am an avid user and every now and then I run into a problem that is frustrating and worrying -given a large number of important files I store on that platform. This post is my placeholder to help myself – and hopefully you!</p>
<p>I recently ran into an issue where my Dropbox icon just kept spinning and spinning and believed it was related to some weird conflict resolution problem across different machines that I had run into by accident.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2020/02/17/use-powershell-to-consume-your-azure-cli-devops-result-set/">Use Powershell to Consume Your Azure Cli Devops Result Set</a></h2>
    <p>Use PowerShell to consume your Azure CLI DevOps result set
Before we get going it is probably first worth me pointing out (in case you are wondering) that the whole premise of this post stems from a lack of native Azure DevOps PowerShell Module. Yes there are a few solutions out there, but at the time of writing there is no official Microsoft PowerShell DevOps module, so we are stuck with using the CLI if you want to avoid using these other solutions.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2020/02/13/rewrite-your-powershell-azurerm-to-az-for-azure-devops-deployments/">Rewrite Your Powershell Azurerm to Az for Azure Devops Deployments</a></h2>
    <p>I just wanted to get a quick post out on specific problem that I have just encountered from one of our Azure DevOps release pipelines in which one of the release stage tasks started failing for no reason (despite no obvious changes having been made). Hopefully this post will help others if you are also experiencing this problem and don’t know what to do.</p>
<p>The error message was as follows for our task <code>Enable Firewall on Data Lake</code></p>
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2020/01/06/using-azure-cli-to-query-azure-devops/">Using Azure Cli to Query Azure Devops</a></h2>
    <p>In previous posts, I have touched upon the use of Azure Cloud Shell for generic querying of Azure resources and I thought it would be useful to quickly document its use for something a little more specific such as querying or manipulating <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/">Azure DevOps</a> through the command line.</p>
<p>For my example, I will focus on something as mundane and straight-forward as querying the Azure DevOps repository meta-data (so that I can look at and compare branch settings against each other) but I hope you get the idea that this is just scratching the tip of the iceberg and the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest">Azure CLI</a> is a powerful tool to add to your arsenal of scripting languages.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/posts/2019/08/29/diversity-at-technical-events-volunteers-and-organisers/">Encouraging diversity at technical events – volunteers and organisers</a></h2>
    <p>In the third and final post of this three-part series, I will be exploring a few thoughts and ideas regarding how we can encourage diversity of <em>volunteers and organisers</em> at technical events. I have been organising events as far back as 2010 so I have (no doubt) been responsible for many failures (and hopefully a few successes) in promoting and hosting events to the community.</p>
<p>Before we start talking about diversity, I think it is first important to define what I mean by this term. According to the Merriam-Webster definition, diversity is “the condition of having or being composed of differing elements” and especially “the inclusion of different types of people (such as people of different races or cultures) in a group or organization”. I don’t quite think this extends far enough, and I see personally see diversity as the inclusion of all people regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, age, size, race, or religion. Our aim, therefore, should be to provide a harassment-free conference experience in which everyone can enjoy this in equal measure.</p>

    <p>It is usually the simplest things that often leave me feeling like I am a complete dummy. One such issue I ran into fairly recently when trying to deploy Cosmos DB into an Azure subscription.</p>

    <p>Thank you to Kendra Little who is hosting this month&rsquo;s T-SQL Tuesday topic on &ldquo;Interviewing Patterns and Anti-Patterns&rdquo; - and what advice I might have for someone preparing for an interview. But instead of regurgitating the obvious advice you can find in other places, I&rsquo;d rather talk about my own personal experiences, in-particular about a specific dark period in my professional career and how I avoided jumping into yet another bad experience.</p>
