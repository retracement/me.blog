<p>Having had the luxury of booking a slightly later flight than normal (9.45am to Seattle), I took the liberty of an overnight stay closer to the airport, but unfortunately for me I had decided upon a Curry for tea the night before and now at 6am I am feeling a little rough and cannot manage my traditional pre-flight bacon sandwich. Not good, but at least my cup of tea is slightly more appealing, and I start to get ready for my trip. I have a 30-minute drive ahead of me to the airport, so I start getting ready and head off.</p>
<p>So far this year, I have probably done an excessive amount of community events, and while this has not been good for my bank balance, it has been very good for my [British Airways}(https://www.britishairways.com/) points. I am now on the Executive Club Silver level, which means entrance to the club lounge without paying for Business Class travel -and even though I was offered an awesome deal to upgrade to Business for this flight, I decided to slum it in <em>Cattle+ Class</em>. So I sit in the lounge for an hour, pray to the Lord of Bacon, and wait for my flight to board.</p>
<p>Upon taking my seat on the plane, I am surprisingly joined by Richard Douglas (<a href="https://SQL.RichardDouglas.co.uk">b</a>|<a href="https://twitter.com/sqlrich">t</a>), and as I settle down to do some more Summit session prep, Richard takes the well-earned opportunity to catch up on some films. Unfortunately for me, my earphone adapter did not seem to work, which meant that when I finally got around to watching some onboard entertainment it was in Mute-Vision. One documentary I did watch with fascination, was a Discovery Channel program to capture <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a>. I love all that <em>&ldquo;stuff&rdquo;</em>, and spent the next hour watching their exploits in the Pacific North-West and the constant looping repeats of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterson%E2%80%93Gimlin_film">Patterson–Gimlin film</a>. Towards the end of the film they actually managed to capture a Bigfoot, and it was at this point I realized that this film had indeed been a Blair Witch Style hoax and a complete waste of an hour of my life!</p>
<p><img src="/images/2016/roastery.webp" alt="roastery"></p>
<p>Upon landing and arriving into the City of Seattle, I dropped my bags off and headed with Richard to my favorite Starbucks (<a href="https://roastery.starbucks.com/">Starbucks Reserve Roastery &amp; Tasting Room</a>) but my GPS was playing tricks on us, and we got slightly more exercise climbing hills than is advisable for someone of my fitness. After consuming a spiffingly good cup of coffee we headed to the <a href="https://taphousegrill.com/">Taphouse</a> for a bite to eat and to watch the <a href="https://www.gohuskies.com/index.aspx">Washington Huskies</a> versus the <a href="https://osubeavers.com/sports/football">Oregon State Beavers</a> on TV in which the Huskies completely dominated the match and ended up winning 41 to 17.</p>
<p>Finally, to end the day, I headed back to my room to continue working on my Thursday Summit Session for a few hours. I’ve got a lot of work still to do on it, but I’m not panicking&hellip; yet!</p>
