Putting on events at this scale by such a small core team demands huge respect and I sincerely thank them for doing so. I have personally learnt a ton of information and grown as a person and as a SQL Professional because of their efforts and I know many others in the industry feel the same way too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are very pleased to announce that the final figures of the SQLSaturday Cambridge fundraising has been counted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of you will know that we were collecting for Children’s Cancer Charity &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.younglivesvscancer.org.uk/&#34;&gt;CLIC Sargent&lt;/a&gt; and the reasons why we were doing this can be understood by reading my previous post &lt;a href=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2013/09/25/change-your-event-and-make-a-difference&#34;&gt;Change (your event) and make a difference!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The amount collected at the event through various different means amounts to &lt;strong&gt;£490.03&lt;/strong&gt;!!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SQLSaturday Cambridge are therefore honoring our commitment to match this figure, which means that &lt;mark&gt;we are therfore donating a grand total of £980.06 to charity&lt;/mark&gt;. I’m hoping to write a bit more about this further in due course.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Change (your event) and make a difference!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Regular readers may remember a post I wrote many moons ago in which I described just how exactly &lt;a href=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2012/05/04/change-and-make-a-difference&#34;&gt;SQLSaturday Cambridge started&lt;/a&gt; and hopefully gave a lesson in why we should all attempt to grow as much as possible as individuals and embrace (unforeseen) opportunities, as and when they appear. These days I suppose you could describe me as a seasoned presenter (note: seasoning doesn’t necessarily equal good 🙂) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlsaturday.com/228/eventhome.aspx&#34;&gt;SQLSaturday Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; is soon to celebrate its second birthday and outing this coming Friday and Saturday. I know I have only just scratched the surface of what I could become and what I would like to be and that I only have myself and genetic limitations to get in the way of my &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;enlightenment&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This will be the very first time that SQLSaturday has happened in Scotland and it is going to be fantastic to bolster the PASS membership and exposure in that area which can only good news for all concerned.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Selected again for the PASS Summit</title>
      <link>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2013/05/22/see-you-in-charlotte/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well it is that time of year again where the results of the PASS Summit 2013 session selections become public. This year was of course a very difficult one to get selected since (I believe) a record number of submissions were received -but thankfully I still managed to knock one session (out of four) into the back of the net. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate all the other selected Speakers (especially if this is your first time at the Summit) and commiserations to all those who were not successful on this occasion. I know the usual inquests and finger pointing will naturally ensue by a small handful of people who feel personally aggrieved that they weren’t successful, but believe me when I say that the process is as fair as I could expect, but not without room for improvement (more on this very soon in a follow up post).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So here goes…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2010 I had traveled to my very first conference as a presenter. So there I was, stood on the stage in front of a motley collection of SQL professionals, realizing the enormity of what was about to happen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Memoirs of SQLSaturday Cambridge #162 - Speaker Dinner</title>
      <link>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2012/10/01/memoirs-of-sqlsaturday-162-part-ii-speaker-dinner/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2012 18:11:00 +0100</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the most over-looked parts of any big or small SQL Event can sometimes be the speaker dinner -which essentially boils down to one thing… the organisers way of showing their appreciation to the speakers who have traveled far and wide usually at their own expense to present expert technical content at no cost to the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a fairly regular speaker myself, I have experienced many events who have either made very little effort with the dinner, poorly handled its organization (meaning many speakers aren’t even informed that it is happening) or simply don’t bother arranging one at all. And whilst I don’t want to suggest that by organizing an event you absolutely &lt;em&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; provide a speaker dinner in order for the event to be regarded as a success, I do personally feel that the speaker meal helps define your event and give it a &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; or your &lt;em&gt;stamp of identity&lt;/em&gt; -and hopefully one along the lines that you were aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Days have passed since we closed the first ever SQLSaturday to hit the shores of the UK and I write with an element of sadness that it is over, relief that my time can start to be more of my own again for other projects, and optimism of what may come.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I first set out on the path of recording what I view as very much a mixture of personal and technical journal in the pages of this blog (and hopefully at times a good resource for others), I always intended to write at least one post per month. I always viewed it as a cardinal sin to let things slip, but unfortunately I truly underestimated the enormity of the work involved in planning, implementing and executing a major IT event. Now it is almost over (there are still many small administrative issues to complete) I think it is fair to say that Team &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlsaturday.com/162/eventhome.aspx&#34;&gt;SQLSaturday #162 Cambridge&lt;/a&gt; are able to take a deep breath and be proud of what we did.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They are all eating and I am not (one too many Whiskys the night before). They all appear to know each other and are vigorously moving from subject to subject with enthusiasm and I am listening intently to the conversation but not really saying too much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Presenting Moves Like Jagger – my 24HOP baptism</title>
      <link>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2012/03/26/moves-like-jagger-my-24hop-baptism/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is now nearly one week since my début on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlpass.org/24hours/spring2012/Home.aspx&#34;&gt;24 Hours Of PASS&lt;/a&gt; and I thought it would be useful for people considering presenting on 24HOP themselves that I write my thoughts on the whole experience. I have also taken the liberty to publish in advance my &lt;a href=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/documents/24hoursofpassppt_moves_like_jagger.pdf&#34;&gt;slide deck&lt;/a&gt;) whilst I have managed to catch a rare quiet period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been very lucky over the last couple of years to have presented many times to a selection of large and small events around the world and yet as nearly all presenters will tell you, we are always still learning the craft. Every event is a new experience, every delivery is different and perfection is always a distant and impossible dream. So although the prospect of talking to an audience was in itself not a particular problem, the difference in delivery medium, scale and truly International audience meant that the whole ball-game had totally changed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many many years ago when I was still in short trousers I started to take an interest in Movies. My parents had completely different sleeping patterns and my Father was an irritatingly early riser -a fact that would irritate me right into my adolescence and beyond. My mother was the opposite and (like me) very much a night owl. This resulted in there being a period of around 3 to 4 hours before my Mother went to bed, where the Television would be switched to whatever channel she wanted to watch -in other words &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Sport.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am almost ashamed to say that I have let over a month pass since my last post and truth be told I have come close a few times without never actually pressing that submit button.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I shan&amp;rsquo;t bore you with my excuses or reasons for my inactivity but what matters is I&amp;rsquo;m back!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing an increasing amount of noise about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sqlpass.org/sqlrally/2012/dallas/&#34;&gt;SQLRally Dallas&lt;/a&gt; and I felt that I wanted to share my own personal experience with you about this rather unique event (in Orlando) -for it quite literary changed my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone old enough to remember this song from the eighties will remember the catchy lyrics and tune:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pass the Duchie pon the left hand side pass the Duchie pon the left hand side&amp;hellip; It gonna burn&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;Ah yes, I&amp;rsquo;ve now got my foot tapping away remembering the good old days of my youth :). The song (as some of you will be aware) is about passing a cooking pot around and sharing food with each other, but the more astute of you will know that it was based upon a track titled &lt;em&gt;Pass the Kouchie&lt;/em&gt; -a ditty about smoking cannabis! &lt;sub&gt;*1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exactly one month to this very day I wrote the article &lt;a href=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2011/09/14/when-should-you-use-nolock&#34;&gt;When should you use NOLOCK?&lt;/a&gt; which explained exactly when the use of the &lt;code&gt;READUNCOMMITTED&lt;/code&gt; isolation level was acceptable and when it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. I also revealed that it not only takes out a &lt;em&gt;Schema Stability (Sch-S)&lt;/em&gt; lock on the object (which is documented in Books Online for the hint) but also took out a special &lt;em&gt;Shared (S) Bulk Operation&lt;/em&gt; lock when used on heaps. This latter behaviour is not even mentioned in Books Online for the hint and as far as I know, has never been documented or mentioned anywhere else before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well the keynote speech has begun, Ted Kummert is on stage and the focus at the beginning has been very much on the Community and SQL Azure. It is clear to me that Microsoft recognize the value of our amazing community -and they should because together we are helping to shape that future of this product into something that is becoming truly amazing. There was a time when Oracle DBA&amp;rsquo;s used to look down on SQL Server, but now they are worried and are desperately trying to get up to speed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well the good news is my alarm clock worked!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the time is around 7:30 am and I managed to get out of bed for my second official appointment of the PASS Summit 2011 and things are getting warmed up. I&amp;rsquo;m sat here on the front row of the Blogger table whilst to my left I have Brent Ozar, Aaron Bertrand and to my right Wes Brown and the Midnight DBA&amp;rsquo;s. If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough in front of me I have Stacia Misner and behind me I have Wendy Dance and Glen Berry! I don&amp;rsquo;t know how I managed this gig but it feels really good and it is an absolute pleasure to be part of it all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At this point in time it is very hard to say exactly how busy I am going to be this week but I suspect that my time here will be slightly more focused than last time since I have a few more responsibilities than before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am very pleased to publish the slide-deck for my Friday presentation &lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event9/READPAST__Furious_Transactions_Locking_and_Isolation&#34;&gt;READPAST &amp;amp; Furious: Transactions, Locking and Isolation&lt;/a&gt;. Just click &lt;a href=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/documents/readpastfurious.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to obtain the slide-deck in PDF format.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had an absolutely fantastic time giving the presentation and really enjoyed the audience participation (though it took some of you guys a bit of time to warm up 🙂). No seriously, the thing that makes all those weeks/ months of preparation and collation of material worthwhile is the possibility that I have managed to communicate something of value to you all -and &lt;em&gt;hopefully&lt;/em&gt; I managed to do that. I learnt a massive amount of stuff myself in the process of preparing for this session and I cannot wait for the next time (whenever this may be).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As someone I&amp;rsquo;ve been following technically for several years, when I saw that his book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Inside-SQL-Server-Query-Optimizer/dp/1906434603&#34;&gt;Inside the SQL Server Query Optimizer&lt;/a&gt; had been released to the Kindle format, I immediately clicked the purchase button and I haven&amp;rsquo;t been disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the very late nineties and early naughties I used to co-habit the Microsoft Newsgroups (which was then located at &lt;em&gt;news.microsoft.com&lt;/em&gt; over the NNTP protocol), and in particular I posted primarily on the SQL Server forums to help others where I could. A by product of my helping out was of course learning lots of hints, tips and best practices from other users and there is a lesson in that for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So today I was surprised (slightly) to pick up a tweet by the excellent Grant Fritchey (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scarydba.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/gfritchey&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;) regarding the fact that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlsolstice.com/&#34;&gt;SQL Solstice&lt;/a&gt; had been cancelled due to a lack of interest. I say that I was only slightly surprised for a few reasons. The first is that the event was a new initiative and just by that very fact, was never going to be a certainty. Secondly, the United States is no stranger to SQL events. Not only do they host the largest SQL Server convention in the world (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlpass.org/summit/2011/&#34;&gt;SQL PASS Summit&lt;/a&gt;), but have also a new initiative called SQLRally, in which I was lucky enough to speak at the inaugural event in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlpass.org/sqlrally/2011/orlando/&#34;&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt; this May just past. I believe the intention for SQLRally is for it to rotate bi-yearly between the States and Europe and the success of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlpass.org/sqlrally/2011/nordic/&#34;&gt;SQLRally Nordic&lt;/a&gt; will (I believe) be the making or death of that initiative. I personally believe SQLRally is work in progress and will become a great success over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The real value of attending SQLRally</title>
      <link>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2011/05/18/the-real-value-of-attending-sqlrally/</link>

      <guid>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2011/05/18/the-real-value-of-attending-sqlrally/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This post was written primarily whilst travelling back from SQLRally and subsequently edited, amended and added to where necessary before publishing)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently sat here at Orlando Airport and I am able to reflect a little bit whilst waiting to board my plane back to the U.K. after having spent the last 5 days of preparation, learning and socialising at SQLRally and I need to ask myself &lt;em&gt;was it worth the expense?&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not too sure how many attendees or indeed speakers were from Europe but I am pretty sure I was one of a very small number and therefore the cost to myself was indeed far more than it would have cost for the majority of the attendees. It is therefore important that I look at the return on investment of not just my attending the event, but also of me speaking. One key thing to remember about going to conferences, is that the knowledge &lt;em&gt;retained&lt;/em&gt; is usually very little of what you have actually heard but hopefully with the efforts of the presenters, the materials provided will help to reinforce the important parts of this knowledge. It is true that I went to some excellent presentations but was sadly unable to attend many of them due to the amount of work I felt I needed to do on the preparation of my own session since I was really not quite happy where I was at. This particular point is a key take home for me, and I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; now ensure that I am far more prepared going forward. Unfortunately due to working commitments, family and other events it is sometimes easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SQLBits 8 - a presenters review</title>
      <link>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2011/04/20/sqlbits-8-finis/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly two weeks has passed after another SQLBits and what another fabulous event. After an incredibly early morning train journey down to Brighton for the excellent Thursday training session with Thomas Kejser and an enjoyable time presenting my &lt;em&gt;SQL Server Clustering for Dummies&lt;/em&gt; session I am well and truly back down to earth with a thump.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personal highs for me were:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Finally getting to meet Allan Hirt and not only that but I had a Geo-Cluster debate with him in the speaker room.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Meeting a few of the new first time SQLBits speakers -in particular Atul Thakor (blog|twitter) who I had a very long chat with in the speaker room and on the morning before his presentation. He had run into lots of problems with his laptop and demos prior to his session -which can strike the best of us, but managed to keep his wits about him an plow onto success when he finally came to present. What a top guy, and look forward to meeting him again in a User Group or another conference.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Recognizing some audience members in my Clustering for Dummies session from my SQLBits 7 session. I ran into a couple of them later on and said a big thanks for the support, gave them my personal email and very much hope they do drop me a mail sometime to say hello.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bumping into some old faces&amp;hellip;people I&amp;rsquo;ve met in Seattle, previous UK conferences and User Groups and old colleagues. A special big-up to Judith Kinsella who made the effort to come to my presentation (which threw me when I saw her in the audience), although she keeps telling me that I remind her of John Peel and just can&amp;rsquo;t take me seriously 🙂🙂🙂&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Being able to enjoy the experience a little more, due to familiarity of proceedings. Anyone who presents at a major conference for the first time will tell you that it is all a bit of a daze, stressful and is a big unknown what you have let yourself in for. This time I knew what to expect, what I was doing and what I needed to do.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Seeing some great presentations.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Excellent weather!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/images/2011/introduction.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mark Broadbent Introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;In full flow!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a very big fan of &lt;em&gt;self-development&lt;/em&gt; materials whether they be books, audio, presentations or simply just ramblings on the Internet and last year during the *Meet an MVP lunch time at the SQL PASS 2010 Summit this was the hotly debated subject on our table.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know these materials generally get a bad press and I always remember a line from one of our comedians here in the UK who was criticising self-improvement training and said &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;the clue is in the name&amp;hellip;.self! &amp;hellip;so why are you listening to someone else!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. For myself I believe that the &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; in the name self-improvement actually means that we always need to examine ourselves (and our behaviour) in order to grow into something better. One thing that I know for sure is that I have a lot of work ahead of me to become the person that I want to be and I know it is within my power to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But why you might ask? (OK well you didn&amp;rsquo;t ask but I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you anyway). 🙂&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason that I decided to make that extra special bit of effort to write something in advance of Tuesday was precisely because I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a Scooby Doo (clue) of what exactly I was going to write about! This was thanks to the chosen subject of the month &lt;em&gt;Aggregation&lt;/em&gt; by the most excellent grrlgeek – Jes Borland (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/grrl_geek&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/All/?author=420&#34;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the coming weeks and months leading up to SQLRally, I will be adding information, news and more detail about my presentation. For now though the root area is live which is effectively the &amp;ldquo;press release&amp;rdquo; provided to the selected speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/tags/sqlrally&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/images/2011/sqlrally_banner_240x120_1.webp&#34; alt=&#34;SQLRally Orlando&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget, if you do see me wandering around in Orlando, to say hello. It&amp;rsquo;s always great to meet new people and I am always humbled by the high level of skill in the SQL community. Also (and most importantly) expanding our IT Professional Support Network will ensure that we always will have an ear to bend when we have technical problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well &lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlbits.com/default.aspx&#34;&gt;SQLBits&lt;/a&gt; 8 voting has now ended so perhaps it is a good time to publish the second and final post of the series. I wonder if any of my sessions will get selected this time? One of my submitted sessions is the same one that has made it to the reserve list for the first ever &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlpass.org/sqlrally/2011/&#34;&gt;SQLRally&lt;/a&gt; in Orlando and although slightly disappointed at just making the reserve list I was very proud that out of all the reserve sessions I came joint top (I took 38% of the vote in my category). The winner of that category is the well known Edwin Sarmiento (&lt;a href=&#34;https://bassplayerdoc.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/bassplayerdoc&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;) and he is an absolutely smashing chap so I&amp;rsquo;m nothing but pleased for him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This time it is being hosted by Pat Wright &lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlasylum.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/SqlAsylum&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; and the subject of the month is all about &amp;ldquo;Automation in SQL Server&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what is my favourite automation script or technique that I use in SQL Server? I had to have a think about this and my problem is that I have quite a few. I believe that the accessibility and usability of the Windows and SQL GUI (and related tools) means that SQL DBAs in particular have a tendency to automate much more than other IT Professionals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The first &amp;ldquo;The Great High Availability Hustle&amp;rdquo; I had been thinking about for a very long time and is hopefully going to fill a void that has existed for too long. As a DBA, if you are not already using Clustering I guarantee that you will be, sooner or later. SQL 2008 finally gave us true HA product for the Enterprise and I believe SQL High Availability is going to start gaining traction and market share over the coming months and years. But there is a problem with this. I believe that probably nearly every DBA that has become competent with SQL Clustering will at one point have had a baptism of fire with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I cannot let the week go by without a special goodbye to an old friend. If you hadn&amp;rsquo;t already heard, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.msdn.com/b/sqlreleaseservices/archive/2010/09/29/end-of-support-for-sql-server-7-0.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0&#34;&gt;SQL 7.0 support officially ended on the 11th January&lt;/a&gt; of this week. This means that as of now, legacy installations of SQL Server 7 are threatened with extinction and is only a matter of time before they become as scarce as SQL 6.5 installs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in how I got started with SQL Server and you haven&amp;rsquo;t done so already, you might want to take a quick peek at my &lt;a href=&#34;https://tenbulls.co.uk/about&#34;&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; page. Here I mention how I quite insightfully (read luckily) took a training opportunity and put myself on a SQL 7 beta course rather than the one my company was expecting – one for SQL 6.5. That decision had a very big effect on my future IT career. Whilst at the training centre I remember that there was a guy there who claimed that he had been one of the first 100 people in the world to certify as an MCSE+i and his efforts to do so had been made a little easier because of the fact that he had apparently been based in Saudi Arabia for six months in a company that had not only a testing centre but all course materials available to him. He said of being out there &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;well what else can you do for 6 months in Saudi? I thought I might as well do something productive!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Firstly let me wish you all a very happy New Year and secondly a big thank you to all of you who have been dropping by my blog and I sincerely hope you continue to do so. I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing at least a 10% month on month growth in traffic since the start of the year and its the prospect that I might be producing something (however remote) of interest to someone makes my efforts even more rewarding. I would also like to pay my respects to all those other Bloggers in the Blogosphere who provide great content for me to consume – more on this in the next few days. Also lets not forget the Tweeps, and if you do both then a huge big-up to you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Speaking at SQLRally 2011!</title>
      <link>https://tenbulls.co.uk/posts/2010/12/16/excited-about-sqlrally-2011/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am very pleased/ proud to announce that I have submitted 2 abstracts for presentations to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlpass.org/sqlrally/2011/&#34;&gt;SQLRally&lt;/a&gt; and should I be chosen they will be given in Orlando, Florida between May 11th to May 13th. For those of you not already aware, SQLRally is a little bit like a mini SQL PASS Summit and enables people from the East Coast of America to visit an event closer to them should they have not been able to attend the PASS Summit due to the distance and cost restrictions. It has been devised to fill the gap between SQL Saturday events and more can be found by visiting this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlpass.org/sqlrally/2011/About.aspx&#34;&gt;url&lt;/a&gt;. I believe it is going to be a great success. Should I be chosen to present at SQLRally, which will be a tall order given the very strong competition it will be only my second time going to a SQL Event in the States (PASS 2010 was my first) it will be my very first visit to the East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Several weeks back I attached my Blackberry to my PC to clear down all the photos in preparation for SQL Pass and I stumbled across these grainy old photos taken during those rainy few days in York. It all seems like a lifetime ago now and much has happened to me since &lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlbits.com&#34;&gt;SQL Bits&lt;/a&gt; 7, but this was my story of an interesting and enjoyable but all too brief few days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I (like many others) rolled into Reading to attend the Speaker Training day held at Microsoft HQ in the UK. This event was organized to help people prepare for speaking at SQLBits 7 (if your submission was successful) or to prepare for a future successful submission (if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t). Upon arriving at Microsoft it was quite funny because the receptionist seemed to recognize me, but since I hadn&amp;rsquo;t been to that building for around 3 years I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how she could have done &amp;hellip;still it&amp;rsquo;s always nice to be &amp;ldquo;recognized&amp;rdquo; 🙂&lt;/p&gt;</description>
